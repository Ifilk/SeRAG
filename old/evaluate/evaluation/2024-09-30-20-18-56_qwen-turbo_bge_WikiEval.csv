Improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies are the basis of the field of theragnostics. For some conditions, medical imaging has enabled non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. When medical imaging is coupled with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics may provide opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself. Techniques such as image-guided radiotherapy, FDG PET for therapy assessment, and molecular-targeted therapies guided by oncogene expression analysis exemplify the integration of diagnostics and therapeutics. Nuclear medicine has played a significant role in the development of these methods, and recent advancements in nanotechnology, specifically nanomedicine, have expanded the therapeutic potential of radiodiagnostics beyond interventional radiology.

Applications
Nuclear medicine
Theranostics originated in the field of nuclear medicine; iodine isotope 131 for the diagnostic study and treatment of thyroid cancer was one of its earliest applications. Nuclear medicine encompasses various substances, either alone or in combination, that can be used for diagnostic imaging and targeted therapy. These substances may include ligands of receptors present on the target tissue or compounds, like iodine, that are internalized by the target through metabolic processes. By utilizing these mechanisms, theranostics enables the localization of pathological tissues with imaging and the targeted destruction of these tissues using high doses of radiation.

Radiological scope
Contrast agents with therapeutic properties have been under development for several years, although they are not yet in clinical use as of 2021. One example is the design of contrast agents capable of releasing a chemotherapeutic agent locally at the target site, triggered by a stimulus provided by the operator. This localized approach aims to increase treatment efficacy and minimize side effects. For instance, ultrasound-based contrast media, such as microbubbles, can accumulate in hypervascularized tissues and release the active ingredient in response to ultrasound waves, thus targeting a specific area chosen by the sonographer. Another approach involves linking monoclonal antibodies (capable of targeting different molecular targets) to nanoparticles. This strategy enhances the drug's affinity and specificity towards the target and enables visualization of the treatment area, such as using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles detectable by magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, these particles can be designed to release chemotherapy agents specifically at the site of binding, producing a local synergistic effect with antibody action. Integrating these methods with medical-nuclear techniques, which offer greater imaging sensitivity, can aid in target identification and treatment monitoring.

Imaging techniques
Positron emission tomography
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in theranostics provides insight into metabolic and molecular processes within the body. The PET scanner detects  photons and creates three-dimensional images that enable visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes. PET imaging utilizes radiotracers that target specific molecules or processes. For example, [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is commonly used to assess glucose metabolism, as cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake. Other radiotracers target specific receptors, enzymes, or transporters, allowing the evaluation of various physiological and pathological processes.In theranostics, PET imaging plays a role in both diagnosis and treatment planning. It aids in the identification and staging of diseases, such as cancer, by visualizing the extent and metabolic activity of tumors. PET scans can also guide treatment decisions by assessing treatment response and monitoring disease progression. Additionally, PET imaging is utilized to determine the suitability of patients for targeted therapies based on specific molecular characteristics, enabling personalized treatment approaches.

Single-photon emission computed tomography
Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is employed in theranostics, utilizing gamma rays emitted by a radiotracer to generate three-dimensional images of the body. SPECT imaging involves the injection of a radiotracer that emits single photons, which are detected by a gamma camera rotating around the patient.SPECT provides functional and anatomical information, allowing the assessment of organ structure, blood flow, and specific molecular targets. It is useful in evaluating diseases that involve altered blood flow or specific receptor expression. For example, SPECT imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) radiopharmaceuticals can assess myocardial perfusion and identify areas of ischemia or infarction in patients with cardiovascular diseases.In theranostics, SPECT imaging helps in identifying disease localization, staging, and assessing the response to therapy. Moreover, SPECT imaging is employed in targeted radionuclide therapy, where the same radiotracer used for diagnostic imaging can be utilized to deliver therapeutic doses of radiation to the diseased tissue.

Magnetic resonance imagine
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that utilizes strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to generate detailed anatomical and functional images of the body. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and is widely used in theranostics for its ability to visualize anatomical structures and assess physiological processes.In theranostics, MRI allows for the detection and characterization of tumors, assessment of tumor extent, and evaluation of treatment response. MRI can provide information on tissue perfusion, diffusion, and metabolism, aiding in the selection of appropriate therapies and monitoring their effectiveness.Advancements in MRI technology have further expanded its capabilities in theranostics. Techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) enable the assessment of brain activation and connectivity, while diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides insights into tissue microstructure. The development of molecular imaging agents, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, allows for targeted imaging and tracking of specific molecular entities.

Therapeutic approaches
Theranostics encompasses a range of therapeutic approaches that are designed to target and treat diseases with enhanced precision.

Targeted drug delivery systems
Targeted drug delivery systems in theranostics facilitate the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to specific disease sites while minimizing off-target effects. These systems employ strategies, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, to encapsulate drugs and enhance their stability, solubility, and bioavailability. By incorporating diagnostic components, such as imaging agents or targeting ligands, into these delivery systems, clinicians can monitor drug distribution and accumulation in real-time, ensuring effective treatment and reducing systemic toxicity. Targeted drug delivery systems hold promise in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions, as they allow for personalized and site-specific therapy.

Description
Dasypoda radchenkoi is a medium-size, solitary Hymenoptera from the species-poor family Melittidae, a wild bee family comprising approximately 150 species globally. The species is near cryptic with the Iberian pantaloon bee Dasypoda morotei, which means that the morphology is both species is highly similar and hardly allows their differentiation. Although tiny morphological features allow to distinguish the females of both species, males remain unidentifiable based on visual examination only. The discovery of Dasypoda radchenkoi as a separate species was initially fortuitous via the genetic barcoding of two specimens, one being the holotype female and the other being a paratype male. The species is only known from the limestone mountains of southern Spain, from where it is thought to be endemic.

Products made by the fishery include frozen raw tentacles, steamed tentacles, and marinated octopus.The business processes octopus catch from various independently owned boats, and has a processing plant in the suburb of O'Connor. The business operates in a fishery with Marine Stewardship Council certification, one of only two octopus fisheries in the world where that is the case. The total catch of Octopus djinda in WA is around 300 tonnes per year, of which Fremantle Octopus processes around 70%. Estimates have placed the sustainable catch rate for the fishery at around 1-2 thousand tonnes per year. Prior to being a valuable commodity, octopus were an annoyance for rock lobster fisherman as a predator of their catch.Around 80% of the fishery's catch is sold domestically in Australia, with 20% exported to foreign markets including the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai.",0.0,0.9999999999666667,0.25,1.0

## 简介

彩虹标志牌计划（Rainbow Plaque programme）是英国的一项方案，旨在设立纪念性牌匾，以纪念LGBTQIA+历史中的重要人物、地点和事件。该计划模仿了由英格兰遗产、地方当局和其他机构运营的现有英国蓝牌计划。

## 目的

### 纪念性与教育性
彩虹标志牌计划的主要目的是通过设立具有象征意义的牌匾来纪念LGBTQIA+历史上的关键人物、地点和时刻，以此增加公众对LGBTQIA+社区贡献和历史的认知和尊重。

### 突出多样性与包容性
通过使用彩虹色环形牌匾，该计划不仅表彰了特定的历史人物，如莱瑟女士（Anne Lister），还强调了多样性、包容性和彩虹联盟（LGBTQIA+）社区的价值。

### 联合倡议与合作
该计划是由约克市民信托（York Civic Trust）和约克LGBT论坛（York LGBT Forum）在2018年共同发起的，旨在纪念莱瑟女士及其伴侣安·沃克，这一举动体现了社区合作和对LGBTQIA+历史的重视。

## 与其它牌匾计划的比较

### 类型与设计
- **彩虹标志牌**：使用蓝色圆形牌匾，周围环绕六种彩虹颜色，是一种独特的设计，旨在区别于传统的蓝牌计划。
- **粉色牌匾**：某些地点使用粉色牌匾来标识LGBTQIA+相关位置，这一想法早于彩虹标志牌出现。

### 实施与目的
- **彩虹标志牌计划**：专注于纪念特定历史人物，如莱瑟女士，以及增加对LGBTQIA+历史的认识。
- **其他牌匾计划**：可能涵盖更广泛的主题或地点，例如名人、地标或历史事件，但这些计划通常不特别强调LGBTQIA+主题。

### 社会影响
- **正面影响**：彩虹标志牌计划得到了顾问维丹娜·夏瓦（Vandana Shiva）的支持，反映了其社会价值和文化意义。
- **争议与批评**：尽管受到支持，但该计划也引发了关于有机农业转型的讨论，涉及科学和农业社区的担忧，包括可能的经济危机和外国货币收入的丧失。

综上所述，彩虹标志牌计划是英国纪念LGBTQIA+历史的独特方式，它在设计、目的和影响方面与传统的牌匾计划有所区别，同时在促进社会对话和增强社区认同感方面发挥了重要作用。","The Rainbow Plaque programme is a UK scheme installing commemorative plaques to highlight significant people, places and moments in LGBTQIA+ history.

Some UK LGBT locations are denoted by pink plaques, an idea that predated rainbow plaques.

History
The rainbow plaque programme was initiated in 2018 by York Civic Trust and the York LGBT Forum to honour lesbian diarist Anne Lister (1791–1840) and her partner Ann Walker, with the first version of a plaque unveiled on 24 July 2018, replaced with amended wording including the word 'lesbian' in February 2019. Temporary cardboard plaques were also placed on key sites during LGBT pride campaigns in York in 2018 and Leeds in 2019.The permanent plaque initiative then extended nationally through the Wandsworth LGBTQ+ Forum and Studio Voltaire, unveiling permanent plaques for Oscar Wilde at Clapham Junction railway station on 24 July 2019, and for the 1980s film My Beautiful Laundrette on Wilcox Road in South Lambeth on 10 September 2021.In 2023, five further rainbow plaques were announced for London, supported by the Mayor of London's Untold Stories Fund and Wandsworth Oasis.
Greenwich Tavern - Then a well-known gay bar, the Gloucester Arms (today the Greenwich Tavern) in Greenwich was the location of a key scene in the 1996 film Beautiful Thing which was set and filmed in Thamesmead and Greenwich in southeast London. The plaque was unveiled at the Greenwich Tavern on 23 July 2023.
Black Lesbian and Gay Centre - Originally established in Haringey in 1985, the centre moved to a converted railway arch in Peckham in 1992. London Lighthouse - Founded in 1986 and based in Ladbroke Grove, the London Lighthouse was a centre and hospice for people with HIV/AIDS.
Haringey Council - Haringey was a pioneer in the LGBTQIA+ rights movement in the 1980s, establishing a Lesbian and Gay Unit in 1986, while the local Positive Images group - formed to increase lesbian and gay visibility - was established in the same year.

Pink plaques
Predating rainbow plaques, pink triangle plaque memorials have memorialised gay people killed in the Holocaust and victims of anti-gay violence. In the UK, the idea of pink plaques to more generally commemorate and celebrate LGBT heritage was promoted in a 1986 book, The Pink Plaque Guide to London, written by Michael Elliman and Frederick Roll and published by Gay Men's Press. Pink plaques were also discussed in Brighton in 2006, and a mobile phone app was later (2020) created to guide users to Brighton pink plaque locations.Pink plaques have been unveiled in some UK locations to celebrate LGBT heritage.",0.8860600866699215,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.7142857142857143

Its construction was completed during the Abbasid Caliphate, specifically between 132 AH (750 CE) and 656 AH (1258 CE). 
The trail's history dates back to the pre-Islamic era, when it was used by tribes, travellers, and commercial caravans to move between Iraq and Western Arabia. Over time, its usage became regular and easier as the water centres, grazing areas, and mining locations along the route transformed into major stations.
During the Abbasid era, the trail served as an important link between Baghdad, the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. The Abbasid caliphs took great interest in the trail, enhanced it with various benefits and facilities, as well as undertook an expansion of the road to make it suitable for use by pilgrims, travellers, and their animals.Historical, geographical, and archaeological sources show that the trail route was designed in a practical and meticulous manner. Along its length from Kufa to Mecca, stations, houses, and resting areas were established. Its surface was paved with stones in sandy and muddy areas.

After the removal of tram tracks along Nanjing Road in 1963, Yingshang No. 1 was merged into Route 20, forming a single trolleybus route that ran between Zhongshan Park and The Bund.In 1999, after part of East Nanjing Road was converted to a pedestrian-only shopping street, Route 20 was rerouted to skip the segment via Jiujiang Road.In 2019, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all 25 trolleybuses running along the route were decorated with pictures depicting the history of the route. That year, it was estimated that as many as 9 out of 10 Shanghai residents had ridden on the route.In the same year, after the entire East Nanjing Road was made pedestrian-only, the terminus was shifted from Jiujiang Road & East No.1 Zhongshan Road to Hankou Road & Middle Sichuan Road.

Fleet
As of May 2023, the route runs on a fleet of 22 Sunwin SWB5129BEV77G trolleybuses. These buses bear a blue retro livery, commemorating the heritage of trams and trolleybuses in Shanghai.

Before Route 20 merged with Yingshang No. 1, the route used 8TR rigid trolleybuses imported from Czechoslovakia, as well as locally built Dahongqi 5000 series trolleybuses.Key developments in the route's fleet include: 

1963: first SKD663 articulated trolleybus entered service on route 20. These would be used for over 15 years, only being replaced in the 1980s. In addition, SK661 trolleybuses were introduced in the 1970s.
1984: the route started using a full fleet of Shanghai SK561GF and SK570 articulated trolleybuses. At this point of time, the route was so popular that daily ridership reached over 70,000, requiring over 65 buses running per day on 30-second headways.
1990s: air-conditioned trolleybuses began entering service on the route.
2004: Shanghai SWB5105KGP-3 and Xianfei HZGWG100K trolleybuses introduced, operating alongside Daewoo and Volvo diesel buses.
2014: Newer Youngman trolleybuses entered service; these were retired in September 2022 when the retro-style Sunwin trolleybuses entered service.",0.8267747540531544,0.0,0.14285714285714285,1.0

He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1968. During his papacy, Benedict advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries. He viewed relativism's denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century. Benedict also revived several traditions, including the Tridentine Mass. He strengthened the relationship between the Catholic Church and art, promoted the use of Latin, and reintroduced traditional papal vestments, for which reason he was called ""the pope of aesthetics"". He was described as ""the main intellectual force in the Church"" since the mid-1980s.On 11 February 2013, Benedict announced his resignation, citing a ""lack of strength of mind and body"" due to his advanced age.

On 15 January 2023, the aircraft being operated on the route, an ATR 72 flown by Yeti Airlines, crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 occupants on board. It is the deadliest accident involving an ATR 72.

Accident
The flight took off from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport at 10:33 am NST. It crashed on the bank of the Seti Gandaki River while on final approach to landing at Pokhara International Airport. A video filmed from the ground showed the aircraft banking steeply to the left before crashing 65 metres (213 ft) away. Another video was streamed live on Facebook by Sonu Jaiswal, a passenger on the plane, before and during the crash. The video shows passengers unaware of the situation until seconds before impact.The crash occurred in Gandaki Province between the old Pokhara Airport and the new Pokhara International Airport, which was opened two weeks earlier and also where the aircraft was intending to land. The accident resulted in the deaths of all 72 people on board, and was Nepal's worst aviation accident since the crash of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 268 in 1992, the deadliest aviation accident in Nepalese domestic aviation, and the deadliest accident involving an ATR 72.According to an official at the Pokhara International Airport, air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 30 heading from east to west, but the captain requested the opposing runway 12 heading from west to east, minutes before the crash. A Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal spokesperson said: ""The weather was clear; according to preliminary information the cause of the crash is the technical issue of the plane.""Flight-tracking organisation Flightradar24 noted that during the flight the aircraft had been transmitting inaccurate speed and altitude data.

Aftermath
The airport was closed as authorities launched a rescue operation. The Government of Nepal summoned an emergency cabinet meeting following the crash. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was deeply saddened by the tragic accident. The Office of the Prime Minister declared 16 January to be a national day of mourning, and the flag of Nepal was flown at half-staff. Yeti Airlines cancelled all regular flights scheduled for the day.

Investigation
Experts noted that the video from the ground taken moments before the crash showed the aircraft's nose noticeably high before the left wing suddenly dropped, probably indicating a stall. Hours after the crash, a five-member committee headed by Nagendra Ghimire was set up to investigate the accident in conjunction with the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety.
On 16 January, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were found; the recorders were examined in Singapore and with assistance from Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, and Transport Safety Investigation Bureau of Singapore. About a month later, on 13 February, a preliminary report was released, which largely reproduced all relevant logs:At 10:56:27, the PF disengaged the Autopilot System (AP) at an altitude of 721 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The PF then called for ""FLAPS 30"" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, ""Flaps 30 and descending"". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap surface movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition...
The flight crew then carried out the ""Before Landing Checklist"" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At the point, Np of both propellers were recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines were at 0%. When propellers are in feather, they are not producing thrust...
At 10:56:54, another click was heard, followed by the flaps surface movement to the 30 degrees position.

When ATC gave the clearance for landing at 10:57:07, the PF mentioned twice that there was no power coming from the engines. At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. At 10:57:20, the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines...
The aircraft's propellers had been feathered for a minute prior to the crash, causing the engine to produce no thrust and lead the vehicle into a stall; the condition levers, which control the propellers, were discovered from the wreckage set to the feathered position. Seconds preceding the crash, the pilots discussed a total lack of power and even moved the power lever to the extreme but failed to recognize that the condition levers were wrongly set. That the condition levers and the flap lever are next to each other in an ATR 72, experts speculate that the monitoring pilot (Kamal KC) had inadvertently moved the former in place of the latter, when asked of by the flying pilot; while, about twenty seconds later, he would set the flap lever properly on his own, he failed to account for his previous mistake, implying that the landing checklist was not properly followed.",0.0,0.9999999999666667,0.8,1.0

These features not only distinguish it from other rockets but also underscore SpaceX’s commitment to advancing space exploration and reducing the cost of space travel through innovative engineering and operational practices.","Starship is a super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. At 120 metres (394 feet) in height and with a liftoff mass of 5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 pounds), Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, surpassing the thrust of NASA's Space Launch System and Saturn V, as well as the Soviet N1, which had previously held the record.The two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle consists of the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the second-stage spacecraft also named Starship. Both stages are powered by Raptor rocket engines, which burn liquid methane and liquid oxygen, operating in a full-flow staged combustion power cycle. Both are designed to be fully reusable, performing controlled landings on the arms of the launch tower used to lift the vehicles and, eventually, reflown within hours. Starship is designed to have a payload capacity of 150 tonnes (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in a fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) when expended. Starship vehicles in low Earth orbit are planned to be refilled with propellant launched in tanker Starships to enable transit to higher energy destinations such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars.Plans for a heavy-lift vehicle at SpaceX date to 2005, with the earliest concept resembling the modern vehicle announced in 2016. SpaceX's Starship development follows an iterative and incremental approach involving frequent, and often destructive, test flights of prototype vehicles. The first and so far only orbital test flight was attempted on 20 April 2023, when an anomaly caused the vehicle to tumble out of control four minutes after launch. SpaceX activated the flight termination system, which fired the explosive charges but did not destroy the vehicle. Approximately 40 seconds later both stages were destroyed due to increased aerodynamic forces.  After the test, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the launch program pending results of a standard ""mishap investigation"".SpaceX intends Starship to become its primary launch vehicle, superseding the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as the Dragon 2 spacecraft currently used as part of NASA's commercial crew program to the International Space Station. Starship is often coupled with the company's Mars ambitions. Planned Starship flights include the development of SpaceX's Starlink internet constellation, crewed flights under the Polaris and dearMoon programs, and two crewed lunar landings with a modified Starship spacecraft under the Artemis program.

History
Starting with a 2012 announcement of plans to develop a rocket with substantially greater capabilities than SpaceX's existing Falcon 9—underpinned by the ambition to enable human exploration and settlement of Mars—the company created a succession of preliminary designs for such a vehicle, under various names (Mars Colonial Transporter, Interplanetary Transport System, BFR) leading up to a 2019 adoption of a stainless-steel body design, which is also when the name changed to the current Starship. SpaceX has since been applying the iterative design methodology, using intensive tests on a series of rocket prototypes. The first prototype, Starhopper, performed several static fires and low-altitude flights. Seven of Starship's upper-stage prototypes were flight tested between August 2020 and May 2021. The last of the seven, a full-size Starship SN15, successfully landed after reaching an altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). A full-scale orbital test flight of the rocket took place on April 20, 2023.

Early design proposals
In 2007, Elon Musk publicly stated that he hopes to enable the exploration and settlement of Mars through SpaceX. SpaceX began developing the Raptor rocket engine before 2014. From 2011 to 2014, Musk made various statements expressing his hope that SpaceX would send humans to Mars in the 2020s to 2030s.

Mars Colonial Transporter
In October 2012, Musk made the first public articulation of plans to develop a fully reusable rocket system with substantially greater capabilities than SpaceX's existing Falcon 9. This new launch vehicle was intended to be part of the company's Mars system architecture, then known as the Mars Colonial Transporter/Mass Cargo Transport (MCT). According to SpaceX, the MCT system would include reusable rocket engines, launch vehicles and space capsules that would enable transportation of humans to Mars and back to Earth. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell gave a potential payload range between 150-200 tonnes to low Earth orbit for the planned rocket. According to SpaceX, the MCT was to be ""going to be much bigger [than Falcon 9]"". In February 2014, the planned principal payload for the MCT was announced to be a large interplanetary spacecraft, designed to carry up to 100 tonnes (220,000 lb) of passengers and cargo. According to SpaceX engine development head Tom Mueller, SpaceX could use nine Raptor engines on a single spacecraft. The preliminary rocket design was to be at least 10 meters (33 ft) in diameter and was expected to have up to three cores totaling at least 27 booster engines.

Interplanetary Transport System
In 2016, Musk changed the name of the Mars Colonial Transporter system to the Interplanetary Transport System  (ITS), as he intended for the system to be capable of traveling beyond Mars. That same year he provided more details about the space mission architecture, launch vehicle, spacecraft, and Raptor engines. The ITS stack was to be composed of two stages, both powered by Raptor engines. A first stage booster, and a second stage that was to be either an ""Interplanetary Spaceship"" for crewed transport or an ""ITS tanker"" for orbital refueling. By that point, Raptor was a rocket engine in a full flow staged combustion cycle, with liquid methane fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. Both propellants enter the combustion chamber completely in the gas phase. A bleed-off of the high-pressure gas would provide autogenous pressurization of the propellant tanks, eliminating the Falcon 9's problematic high-pressure helium pressurization system.The overall launch vehicle height, (first and second stages), was to be 122 m (400 ft). Both stages were to have been constructed of carbon fiber, including the cryogenic propellant tanks, a major change for SpaceX from the Falcon 9's aluminum-lithium alloy tank and structure material. Both stages were to be fully reusable and were to land vertically. The ITS booster was to be a 12 m-diameter (39 ft), 77.5 m-high (254 ft), reusable first stage powered by 42 engines, each producing 3,024 kilonewtons (680,000 lbf) of thrust. Total booster thrust would have been about 128 MN (29,000,000 lbf) at liftoff, several times the 36 MN (8,000,000 lbf) thrust of the Saturn V. The engine configuration included 21 engines in an outer ring and 14 in an inner ring. The center cluster of seven engines was to be gimbaled for directional control, although some directional control  was to be performed via differential thrust on the fixed engines.

Myosotis angustata, a species of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. This plant is characterized by its perennial rosette growth habit, ebracteate inflorescences, and white corollas with fully exserted stamens. Its rosette leaves, which have broad petioles making differentiation from the leaf blades challenging, measure approximately 20 mm in length by 4 mm in width. 

The distinguishing features of Myosotis angustata include its narrower leaves compared to those of M. traversii, along with relatively longer anthers, among other differences. Two specimens of Myosotis angustata have been included in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequencing markers for New Zealand Myosotis species.

Unfortunately, specific conservation status information for Myosotis angustata is not readily available in the provided data. For accurate conservation status, it would be advisable to consult a more comprehensive botanical database or a local conservation organization.","Myosotis angustata is a species of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Thomas Cheeseman described the species in 1906. Plants of this species of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes with ebracteate inflorescences and white corollas with stamens that are wholly exserted.

Taxonomy and etymology
Myosotis angustata Cheeseman is in the plant family Boraginaceae. It was originally described by New Zealand botanist Thomas Cheeseman in his Manual of the New Zealand Flora in 1906. The most recent treatment of this species was done by Lucy B. Moore in the Flora of New Zealand.The original specimens (syntypes) of this species were collected by Cheeseman in ""Mt Arthur Plateau and Raglan Mountains"", South Island, New Zealand. The specimens collected by Cheeseman are housed at the herbarium of the Auckland War Memorial Museum (AK).
Cheeseman noted that M. angustata is morphologically very similar to M. traversii, and made the following distinction between the two species:""Short, stout, densely hispid, 2–6 in. high. Leaves linear-spathulate. Racemes short, capitate. Flowers 1/4–1/3 in. long, lemon-yellow. Filaments very short, the tip of the anthers just above the scales....................10. M. Traversii.

Size and habit of M. Traversii, but leaves rather narrower. Racemes capitate. Flowers Jan., white. Filaments as long as the anthers, which are wholly above the scales...........................................................11. M. angustata.""

Phylogeny
Two individuals of M. angustata have been included in phylogenetic analyses of standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA regions) of New Zealand Myosotis. Within the southern hemisphere lineage, species relationships, including those of the two individual sequenced of M. angustata, were not well resolved.

Description
Myosotis angustata plants are rosettes. The rosette leaves have broad petioles that difficult to distinguish from the leaf blades. The rosette leaves are about 20 mm long by 4 mm wide (length: width ratio 5: 1), usually linear-spathulate and widest at or above the middle, with an subacute apex. Both surfaces of the leaf are uniformly and densely covered in appressed hairs, with lower density on the lower surface. Each rosette has several ascending to erect, ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 150 mm long. The cauline leaves are similar to the rosette leaves, but become smaller, are linear or narrow-oblong and subacute, and have hairs similar to the rosette leaves. The flowers are many per inflorescence, and each is borne on a short pedicel, each with a bract. The calyx is 5–8 mm long at flowering and fruiting, lobed to one-half of its length, and densely covered in straight hairs, as well as some hooked hairs, all of which are antrorse. The corolla is white and about 7 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, and small scales alternating with the petals. The anthers are exserted with the anthers surpassing the faucal scales. The nutlets are 2.2 mm long by 1 mm wide.The pollen of Myosotis angustata is unknown.
The chromosome number of M. angustata is unknown.
Flowering and fruiting in January.

Distribution and habitat
Myosotis angustata is a forget-me-not originally collected from Mt Arthur and Raglan Range, in the northern part of the South Island, New Zealand. It is currently considered to be extant only in Kahurangi National Park.

Conservation status
Myosotis angustata is listed as Threatened – Nationally Critical with the qualifiers Data Poor (DP) and Range Restricted (RR) on the most recent assessment (2017-2018) under the New Zealand Threatened Classification system for plants.

## Location and Elevation
Mount Brown is situated in Liberty County, Montana, United States. It holds the distinction of being the highest point within the county, the highest point of the East Butte complex, and the second-highest peak in the Sweet Grass Hills. With an elevation of 6,958 feet or 2,121 meters, it stands prominently as a notable geographical feature in the region.

## Climate
The mountain is classified under a semi-arid climate zone. This climate is characterized by long, cold, and dry winters and hot summers with cool nights. Winter temperatures can plummet below -10 °F, and there are instances where wind chill factors drop below -30 °F. The wettest part of the year typically falls between May and August, with an annual precipitation of up to 20 inches accumulating on the peak.

## Nearby Landmarks
Mount Brown is approximately 26 miles (42 km) north of Chester, Montana, and is located just eight miles (13 km) south of the Canada–United States border.

## Drainage
Precipitation runoff from the mountain flows northward into the Milk River.

## Historical Context (Not directly related to location and elevation)
The reference to ""the Messiah on his first coming"" and the discussion about the Bible's Gospel of Matthew stating ""His blood be upon us and upon our children,"" is not directly related to the location and elevation of Mount Brown. This information pertains to a broader discussion on historical interpretations and religious texts, which might be relevant to understanding cultural contexts or historical narratives but does not influence the geographical details of Mount Brown.","Mount Brown is a 6,958-foot-elevation (2,121-meter) mountain summit located in Liberty County, Montana, United States.

Description
Mount Brown is the highest point in the county, highest point of the East Butte complex, and second-highest peak in the Sweet Grass Hills. It is situated 26 miles (42 km) north of Chester, Montana, and eight miles (13 km) south of the Canada–United States border. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north to the Milk River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,000 feet (910 meters) above the surrounding plains in four miles (6.4 km) which makes it a prominent landmark visible for many miles. The slopes provide habitat for elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer.

Geology
Mount Brown is an exposed laccolith composed of syenitic  and monzonitic trachytes created by an igneous intrusion through older Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks during the Eocene, about 50 million years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily shale and siltstone. Over time, erosion of the sedimentary rock has exposed the solidified laccolith which is more resistant to weathering.

History
The Sweet Grass Hills, which are centered in buffalo hunting territory, are sacred to the Blackfoot and other tribes. The Blackfoot called East Butte ""pinapitsékatúyis"" which means ""east side sweet pine."" In 1806, Meriwether Lewis sighted the mountains from the Missouri River, which is 100 miles (160 km) distant, and George Mercer Dawson reported seeing them from 140 miles (230 km) away at Blackfoot Crossing in Alberta. The landform's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.

Climate
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Brown is located in a semi-arid climate zone with long, cold, dry winters and hot summers with cool nights. Winter temperatures can drop below −10 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The wettest period of the year is generally May through August, with up to 20 inches of precipitation falling annually on the peak.

Alexander Stewart, the Wolf of Badenoch
Stuart was the third surviving son  son of king Robert II of Scotland (1316 – 1390). He is known to history as the deeply unpopular ""Wolf of Badenoch"", a name given due to  his notorious cruelty, in particular for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its 13th-century cathedral in May 1370, for which he earned a reputation as ""an enemy of the Church"", and was described in 2017 as ""Scothland's vilest man"".

Description
The tomb is inscribed with the year 1420.The monument remains in its origional position behind the choir screen at the east-end of the cathedral, while Stuart's grave is underneath.

Effigy
The effigy is made from grey–green marble and measures 7 ft (2.1 m) in length. Stewart lies on a cloak and is dressed in full armour with his sword by his left slide. His head is protected by a bascinet (an open-faced combat helmet) and visor and he wears a pauldron—a type of spaulder covering the shoulders. He has a breastplate over his torso, above a plate-skirt at his hips. He has a hip-belt of a type worn in Scotland until the end of the 15th century.The animal resting at his feet may be a lion, or—less likely—a dog.
The effigy is in poor condition, having been damaged c. 1560 during the Scottish Reformation. It now consists of four separate pieces having been broken apart at the neck, waist, knees and ankles. His right foot is missing and his face and left foot are severely damaged. However, it remains one of the best preserved pieces of royal medieval Scottish sculpture.

Altar tomb
The altar (or ""chest"") tomb contains 22 pleurants (or ""weepers"", that is sculpted figures representing mourners) dressed in armour; eight on each long-side and three at each end. These figures are positioned under three-arch canopies and separated by small buttresses.The Latin inscription is placed on the edge of the stone slab below the effigy. It reads, ""His Jacet Domninus Alexander Senescallus, Dominus De Badenoch, Bonæ Memorle, Qui Obit 24 Die Mensis Julii, Anno Domini 1394"".

### 城市背景与战略位置

- **地理位置**：马里乌波尔位于乌克兰顿巴斯地区，最初在被占领期间由顿巴斯人民共和国控制，后者得到俄罗斯军队的支持。随后，俄罗斯单方面吞并了乌克兰东南部，并截至2023年5月10日，马里乌波尔直接处于俄罗斯控制之下。

### 马里乌波尔的战略重要性

- **城市规模与人口**：作为乌克兰控制区域中顿巴斯州最大的城市，同时也是乌克兰最大的俄语人群聚居地之一（依据统计资料），马里乌波尔具有重要的战略地位。
- **工业中心**：这座城市是重要的工业枢纽，拥有伊里奇和亚速钢铁厂等大型企业，同时，它是亚速海沿岸的最大城市。

### 围攻过程与时间线

- **围攻开始**：鉴于马里乌波尔作为战略要地的地位，俄罗斯军队将其视为目标。
- **弹药耗尽**：由于俄罗斯军队弹药即将耗尽，分析人士认为马里乌波尔将在一周内陷落。

### 结果概述

尽管具体围攻持续的时间没有明确提及，但可以推断基于分析人士的预测，围攻马里乌波尔的过程相对较短，最终导致该城市的陷落。然而，确切的结束日期和后续情况未在提供的信息中详细说明。","The Siege of Mariupol began on 24 February 2022 and lasted until 20 May, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It saw fighting between the Russian Armed Forces (alongside the Donetsk People's Republic People's Militia) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control over Mariupol. Lasting for almost three months, the siege ended in a victory for Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic, as Ukraine lost control of the city amidst Russia's eastern Ukraine offensive and southern Ukraine offensive; all Ukrainian troops remaining in the city surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works on 20 May 2022, after they were ordered to cease fighting.Mariupol is located in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, and following the siege, it was initially controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic, supported by occupying Russian troops. However, it was later subjected to Russia's unilateral annexation of southeastern Ukraine, and remains under direct Russian control as of 10 May 2023.
During the Russian siege, the Red Cross described the situation in Mariupol as ""apocalyptic"" while Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of engineering a major humanitarian crisis in the city. Ukrainian officials reported that approximately 25,000 civilians had been killed and that at least 95% of the city had been destroyed during the fighting, primarily by large-scale Russian bombardments. In an official statement, the United Nations confirmed the deaths of 1,348 civilians in Mariupol, but warned that the true death toll was likely thousands higher while also reporting that 90% of the city's residential buildings had been damaged or completely destroyed.Major combat operations in the city effectively ended on 16 May 2022 after Ukraine's Azov Regiment surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works. Some Western reports described the siege as a pyrrhic or symbolic Russian victory, with others noting that the humanitarian impact of the takeover was a ""reputational disaster"" for Russia. However, the loss of the city has also been seen as a significant defeat for Ukraine.

Background
Mariupol was considered a major strategic city and therefore was a target for Russian forces. It was the largest city in the Ukrainian-controlled portion of Donetsk Oblast, and was also one of the largest Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Mariupol was a major industrial hub, home of the Illich and Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, and the largest city on the Sea of Azov.Control of its port on the western shore of the Sea of Azov is vital to the economy of Ukraine. For Russia, it would allow a land route to Crimea and allow passage by Russian marine traffic. Capturing the city gave Russia full control over the Sea of Azov.In 2014 after the Revolution of Dignity, Mariupol was swept by pro-Russian protests against the new government. Tensions erupted into the war in Donbas in early May, and during the unrest, militiamen of the separatist and Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) took control of the city and forced Ukrainian troops to abandon it during the first battle for Mariupol. However, the following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the city in an offensive. In August, the DPR and Russian troops captured the village of Novoazovsk, 45 km east of Mariupol near the Russo-Ukrainian border. With the town captured and forces renewed, in September the DPR attempted to capture the city again in the second battle for Mariupol. Fighting reached the eastern outskirts, but the separatists were eventually repelled. In October, then-DPR Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko vowed to retake the city. Mariupol was then indiscriminately bombed by rockets in January 2015. Fearing a future third offensive into Mariupol, in February Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack into Shyrokyne, a village located 11 km east of Mariupol with the objective of expelling the separatist forces from the city limits and creating a buffer zone. The separatists withdrew from Shyrokyne four months later. The conflict was frozen when the Minsk II ceasefire agreement was signed in 2015.2018 saw again tension in the region around Mariupol, as the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to transit from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol. The Kerch Strait incident raised tensions, and martial law was briefly declared by Ukraine in fears that a war would break out between the two countries.One of the most instrumental groups for the recapture and subsequent defenses of Mariupol was the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian volunteer militia, controversial for its openly neo-Nazi and ultranationalist members. By November 2014 Azov was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine, with Mariupol as its headquarters. As one of Vladimir Putin's stated goals for the invasion was the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, Mariupol represented an important ideological and symbolical target for the Russian forces.Prior to the siege, around 100,000 residents left Mariupol, according to the city's deputy mayor.Prior to falling to Russian forces, the city was defended by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, the Ukrainian Naval Infantry, the National Guard of Ukraine (primarily the Azov Regiment), the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine, and irregular forces.

Advances to Mariupol
Preliminary shelling and advance on the city
On 24 February, the day the invasion began, Russian artillery bombarded the city, reportedly injuring 26 people.On the morning of 25 February, Russian forces advanced from DPR territory in the east towards Mariupol. They encountered Ukrainian forces near the village of Pavlopil, whom repelled the Russian advance. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, said 22 Russian tanks had been destroyed in the skirmish. That evening, the Russian Navy, drawing on the capabilities provided by the Black Sea Fleet, reportedly began an amphibious assault on the Sea of Azov coastline 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defense official stated that the Russians may have deployed thousands of marines from this beachhead.On 26 February, Russian forces continued to bombard Mariupol with artillery. Later, the government of Greece announced that ten ethnic Greek civilians had been killed by Russian strikes at Mariupol, six in the village of Sartana and four in the village of Buhas.On the morning of 27 February, mayor Boychenko said that a Russian tank column had advanced on Mariupol from the DPR, but this attack was repulsed by Ukrainian forces, with six Russian soldiers captured. Later that day, a 6-year-old girl in Mariupol was killed by Russian shelling. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of Donetsk Oblast, stated that fighting in Mariupol had continued throughout the night of 27 February.Throughout 28 February, the city remained under Ukrainian control despite being surrounded by Russian troops and constantly shelled. Electricity, gas, and internet connection to most of the city was cut during the evening. Later, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Russian Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was killed by a Ukrainian sniper near Mariupol, but other sources said that he had been killed during the Kyiv offensive.

Mariupol surrounded
On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the nearby city of Volnovakha and that they would soon do the same to Mariupol. Russian artillery later bombarded Mariupol, causing over 21 injuries.The city was fully surrounded on 2 March, after which the siege intensified. Russian shelling killed a teenager and wounded two other teenagers who were playing soccer outside. Boychenko announced the city was suffering from a water outage and had experienced massive casualties. He also said Russian forces were preventing civilians from exiting.
Later on 2 March, Russian artillery targeted a densely populated neighborhood of Mariupol, shelling it",0.7705205002004387,0.5833333333041666,0.5,1.0

### 一、政策调整与经济转型

- **税制改革**：税制的调整被认为是引发危机的一个重要因素。税制的改变可能影响了投资者信心和经济活动，导致资金流动不稳定。

- **货币创造**：货币供应量的增加也可能对经济造成压力，可能导致通货膨胀加剧，影响价格稳定和货币价值。

- **农业政策转变**：全国范围内的政策转向有机或生物农业，这种突然的变化可能对依赖传统农业的经济体系造成冲击，影响食品供应和价格稳定性。

### 二、债务累积与经济战后重建

- **政府债务累积**：在结束内战后的政府时期，累积的债务变得不可持续，为后续的经济危机埋下了伏笔。

- **经济重建**：结束冲突后的国家往往需要大量投资进行重建，这些债务如果管理不当，可能会成为经济稳定性的重大隐患。

### 三、外部挑战与内部困境交织

- **外汇储备枯竭**：外汇储备的大幅减少限制了国家应对危机的能力，包括支付进口商品和服务的能力。

- **通胀激增**：前所未有的高通胀水平影响了民众的生活成本，加剧了社会不满情绪。

- **医疗物资短缺**：危机期间，基本生活必需品的短缺问题也包括了医疗物资，影响了公共卫生系统的运作。

Sri Lanka had been earmarked for sovereign default, as the remaining foreign exchange reserves of US$1.9 billion as of March 2022 would not be sufficient to pay the country's foreign debt obligations for 2022, with $4 billion to be repaid. An International Sovereign Bond repayment of $1 billion was due to be paid by the government in July 2022. Bloomberg reported that Sri Lanka had a total of $8.6 billion in repayments due in 2022, including both local debt and foreign debt. In April 2022, the Sri Lankan government announced that it was defaulting, making it the first sovereign default in Sri Lankan history since its independence in 1948 and the first state in the Asia-Pacific region to enter sovereign default in the 21st century.In June 2022, then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in parliament that the economy had collapsed, leaving it unable to pay for essentials.In September 2022, a United Nations report said that the economic crisis is a result of officials' impunity for human rights abuses and economic crimes. According to the Sri Lankan finance ministry, the country's foreign reserves had grown by 23.5% from US$1.7 billion in September 2022 to US$2.1 billion in February 2023, representing a US$400 million increase. Sri Lanka teeters on the edge of financial insolvency and has halted repayments on its international debts.

Background
According to W. A. Wijewardena, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the country was a long way into an economic crisis in 2015. The government that came into power in 2015 knew this and had been warned by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka about a number of risks. While the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 had presented a strong economic policy to address the situation, the coalition government could not get the policy pushed through Parliament, which would eventually result in further policy confusion in the coming months.The government did not adequately address the economic warnings and emerging dangers, consuming itself in other government related activities such as ""constitutional reforms"". Certain practices, including those used by the Ministry of Finance led by Ravi Karunanayake, were globally frowned upon. Election related economic decisions were pushed such as excessive distribution of freebies. The Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka's 2014 State of the Economy Report highlighted hot money, worrying borrowing practices, temporary and superficial quick-fixes and monopoly of foreign direct investment flow into the hospitality sector.Further political turmoil in 2018 worsened the economic outlook. By that time the government had carried out several reforms under an IMF supported program towards fiscal monetary consolidation and had successfully controlled inflation. These reforms included an automatic fuel pricing formula which significantly reduced fiscal risks posed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), raised the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 11 percent to 15 percent, and broadened the VAT base by removing exemptions. Many of the reforms were reversed by the new government after the 2019 elections.Under Maithripala Sirisena administration, the 2019 Central Bank Bill was drafted to make the Central Bank independent from political influence by banning the Treasury Secretary and any member of the Government from becoming members of the Monetary Board. Money printing was also to be banned under this bill, as it states: ""The Central Bank shall not purchase securities issued by the government, by any government-owned entity, or any other public entity in the primary market."" Then Central Bank Governor, Indrajit Coomaraswamy, noted Balance of Payments issues, increased inflation, and asset bubbles as reasons for the ban. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Party opposed an independent Central Bank and discarded the bill as soon as they came to power.Many experts compared Lebanon's economic situation with that of Sri Lanka and had warned that Sri Lanka too was on the way to defaulting on its sovereign bonds. Both nations had similar issues, including deep economic crises occurring after their successive governments piled up unsustainable debts following the end of civil wars. To reduce the inflation and control the economy crisis in April 2022, Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe was appointed as the 17th Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to replace Ajith Nivard Cabraal.

Causes
Tax cuts and money creation
The Government of Sri Lanka under president Gotabaya Rajapaksa made large tax cuts that affected government revenue and fiscal policies, causing budget deficits to soar.  These cuts included increased tax-free thresholds that resulted in a 33.5% decline in registered taxpayers, reducing VAT to 8%, reducing corporate tax from  28% to 24%, the abolishment of the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax and the 2% “nation-building tax” which financed infrastructure development. The massive loss of tax revenue resulted in rating agencies downgrading the sovereign credit rating making it harder to take more debt. In 2021 P. B. Jayasundera stated that President Rajapaksa was aware of the loss of revenue but considered it an ""investment"" and had no plans of increasing taxes for another 5 years.To cover government spending, the Central Bank began printing money in record amounts ignoring advice from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stop printing money and instead hike interest rates and raise taxes while cutting spending.  The IMF warned that continuing to print money would lead to an economic implosion. The tax cuts were also opposed by the former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera who noted that as the Sri Lankan government already had far less tax revenue relative to most countries which combined with its high debt load tax cuts would be dangerous. Samaraweera predicted that “If these proposals are implemented like this not only will the entire country go bankrupt, but the entire country will become another Venezuela or another Greece.”On 6 April 2022, the CBSL allegedly printed 119.08 billion rupees, making it the highest reported amount printed on a single day by the CBSL for the year 2022. The total money added to financial markets for the year 2022 increased to Rs. 432.76 billion.

External debt
Until mid-2000s, the Sri Lankan debt was mainly from multilateral lending agencies, after which it was reoriented under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa to foreign investors and lenders. Sri Lanka issues its first international sovereign bond in 2007, with high interest rates to incentivise investors. According to commentators, the money was used to fund vanity projects rather than projects of national utility.Sri Lanka's foreign debt increased substantially, going from US$11.3 billion in 2005 to $56.3 billion in 2020. While foreign debt was about 42% of the GDP in 2019, it rose to 119% of its GDP in 2021. By February 2022, the country had only $2.31 billion left in its reserves, yet faces debt repayments of around $4 billion in 2022, which also includes a $1 billion international sovereign bond (ISB) maturing in July.In 2020, US economist Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, published a report that blamed the quantitative easing policy made by US banks after 2008, for exporting debt bubbles to deve",0.0,0.9999999999666667,,1.0

Tectonic setting
Hormozgan province lies at the southern margin of the collision zone between the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate. This collision lead to the creation of the Zagros Mountains and the Iranian Plateau. The main fault system that runs through the Zagros Range is the Zagros fold and thrust belt, which has been responsible for causing many earthquakes in Iran over the years.

Earthquake
This earthquake is part of a sequence of earthquakes on 1 July, 2022, in southern Iran that began with a magnitude 6.0, followed by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock two hours later, and a magnitude 6.0 earthquake one minute after the magnitude 5.7 earthquake. The first two events were initially reported as 6.1 magnitude, while the third was an initial 6.2. They were revised down several hours later. Earthquake sequences similar to this one have previously occurred in the Zagros Mountains, with a similar sequence occurring in November 2021.

Aftershocks
By 3 July, there were twelve aftershocks, the strongest of which was 5.7 Mw. On July 23, two more aftershocks occurred, measuring 5.4 and 5.6 Mw . The two quakes caused further damage to houses, and caused one indirect injury.

Intensity
The earthquakes had a maximum intensity of VII (Very strong). The strongest shaking was reported in the provinces of Hormozgan and Fars. The earthquake was felt throughout the Middle East in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, as well as parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were severely affected by a more deadly earthquake 10 days earlier.

Other events
Two offshore earthquakes occurred in the same province near the town of Kish a month before the July events. The earthquakes measured 5.5 and 5.6 on the moment magnitude scale, and occurred at a depth of 10.0 km. The first earthquake injured four and damaged 20 buildings. The latter caused one death and 37 injuries.Another earthquake, measuring magnitude 5.9 struck the same area on March 16 of that same year. It caused two injuries and minor damage in several villages.

Impact
Twelve towns and over 300 villages, with a combined population of around 900,000, were impacted by the earthquakes. The village of Sayeh Khvosh, home to around 1,100 people, was completely destroyed. The governor of Hormozgan, Mahdi Dousti, said that it would take several months to rebuild the village. In Bandar Khamir, at least 45 houses were affected, and 35 others were damaged in the town of Kong. In total, at least 392 houses were damaged or destroyed. There were also reports of power outages. A road between Bandar Khamir and Bandar Lengeh was blocked by a landslide. Seven people were killed and 111 others were injured. At least 22 of the injuries were serious enough to require hospitalisation.

## Gig Worker Classification
- Uber classifies its drivers as gig workers or independent contractors, which has sparked legal actions across various jurisdictions.

## Impact on Taxi Businesses and Traffic Congestion
- Uber's operations have disrupted traditional taxi businesses and have been alleged to contribute to increased traffic congestion.

## Legal Actions
- In April 2021, Uber faced a court ruling in Amsterdam for terminating six drivers due to algorithmic decisions, which violated Article 22 of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This rule pertains to automated decisions that can lead to legal or significant impacts. Uber contested the ruling, but the decision was upheld.

## Regulatory Compliance and Strategy
- Uber has been criticized for starting operations in cities without considering local regulations.
- When faced with regulatory challenges, Uber has sought public support for its services and engaged in political campaigns, often backed by lobbying efforts, to alter regulations. This strategy has been described as seeking forgiveness rather than permission.

## Dispute over Company Classification
- Uber argues it is a technology company, not a traditional taxi company, which allows it to avoid certain regulations affecting taxi companies.

These controversies highlight the complex relationship between Uber and regulatory bodies, as well as the broader societal implications of its business model.","Uber Technologies, Inc.  or Uber has been the subject of a number of controversies. These include both unethical business practices such as flouting local regulations and sabotaging competitors. It has also received criticism for its treatment of employees, facing claims of racial discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Concerns have also been raised about Uber's retention of customer data, particularly in the wake of their handling of data leaks. These issues have led to the company being banned from operating in some countries.

Ignoring and evading local regulations
Uber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is ""a technology company"" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber's strategy was generally to ""seek forgiveness rather than permission"". In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber's response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy.  Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber's policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law. Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial.In March 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called ""Greyball"" to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose. The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017.  A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a ""panic button"" system, codenamed ""Ripley"", that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids. Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.

Attempts to sabotage competitors
In 2014, Uber employees were caught ordering and then quickly cancelling rides on competing services Lyft and Gett, in an attempt to disrupt these services. In 2014, Uber was also accused of recruiting people to use competing services for the sole purpose of recruiting their drivers to Uber, at which point the recruiter would receive a commission. Uber denied that it had any involvement with the cancellation of orders or the recruitment efforts.

Wage disputes
In January 2017, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of having misled drivers about potential earnings.In 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of thousands of Uber drivers, alleging that Uber’s “upfront prices” policy did not provide drivers with the 80% of fares to which they were entitled. The lawsuit was settled for $345,622, with each driver in the class getting at least $20.In May 2017, after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in New York, Uber admitted to underpaying New York City drivers tens of millions of dollars over 2.5 years by calculating driver commissions on a net amount. Uber agreed to pay the amounts owed plus interest.

Boycott in the US
In late January 2017, GrabYourWallet advised to boycott Uber because the company did not join its Protests against Executive Order 13769, while Travis Kalanick, then CEO of Uber, was a member of Donald Trump's ""business advisory council"" and GrabYourWallet was advising boycotts of businesses with ties to Trump. Approximately 200,000 users deleted the Uber mobile app. On February 2, 2017, Kalanick resigned from the council, which disbanded in August 2017.

Sexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017)
On February 19, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident. Kalanick was alleged to have been aware of the complaint. On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search. After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber's board of directors, in June 2017, Uber fired over 20 employees. Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to ""dig up dirt"" on the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each. In December 2019, Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares.

God view and privacy concerns
In November 2014, then U.S. Senator Al Franken, Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, expressed concerns regarding ride sharing privacy, specifically Uber's ""God View"", whereby the whereabouts of specific customers, including journalists and politicians, are able to be tracked by Uber insiders. In December 2014, in response to Franken, Uber implemented restrictions on that function.In 2012, an Uber employee tracked the frequency of probable one-night stands in six U.S. cities by day and neighborhood, by correlating late-night and next-day trips. The blog posting coined the term ""ride of glory"" for the Uber equivalent of a walk of shame.

Delayed disclosure of data breaches
On February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior. Names and license plate information from approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014, but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals.An announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers' license information.

Damage from the attack left up to 40,000 residential and business customers without electrical power. Initial estimates were that up to four days could be required to fully restore power in the area. A state of emergency and corresponding curfew were enacted by local government officials in the wake of the incident.

Background
Less than two weeks prior to the Moore County substation incident, the FBI had sent a report to private industry in which they stated that there had been an increase in reported threats to electric infrastructure from people who espouse “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideology"", with an aim of creating civil disorder and inspiring further violence. The Department of Homeland Security cited
a 14-page document released in a Telegram channel favored by accelerationist groups seeking to speed the overthrow of the US government featured a white supremacist instruction guide to low-tech attacks meant to bring chaos, including how to attack a power grid with guns.
While it is unclear whether such threats are directly associated with this attack, government officials have previously expressed concern over the possibility of violent extremists attacking the electrical grid. Prior to the Moore County attack, other attacks on the electrical grid had occurred in Metcalf, California in 2013, in Arkansas in 2013, in Utah in 2016, and in Washington and Oregon (dates undisclosed).

Attack
According to Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields, a Duke Energy power substation was severely damaged by gunfire in Carthage at around 7 p.m. Gunfire was later directed at a second substation in West End, ultimately resulting in a loss of electrical power to the majority of the county. A journalist from a local newspaper reported that one of the substations' gates had been damaged and was lying in an access road, with the pole holding the gate having been snapped off at the ground.Outages began starting just after 7 p.m. on December 4 in Moore County and spread to central and southern parts of the county, with roughly 36,000 customers reported to be without power. Duke Energy officials indicated that significant, serious damage had occurred to equipment located at the substations and that repairs could take several days.

Investigation
In addition to the Moore County Sheriff's Department, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and police departments from all eleven municipalities in Moore County are participating in the investigation. The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) of the Department of Energy is also reported to be assisting.Investigators revealed that they had recovered about two dozen shell-casings, described as being from a ""high powered rifle"", from the attack sites. These casings were expected to be used to query the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network for possible matches with casings fired from the same weapon at other crime scenes. The casings, some of the only physical evidence available, were also being looked at as a starting point which could lead to other evidence such as tire tracks or shoe prints.On December 7, 2022, Governor Roy Cooper announced that a reward of up to $75,000 was being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. The money consists of three separate $25,000 rewards, offered by the State of North Carolina, Duke Energy, and Moore County.

Motive
Officials have described the attack as ""targeted"" and ""intentional, willful and malicious"" but did not immediately provide any information on suspects or a motive for the attack.After the incident, numerous posts on the internet have speculated that the attack was an attempt to disrupt a local drag show that was taking place in the nearby town of Southern Pines that evening; however, these claims are unconfirmed and disputed.By December 7, investigators were focusing on two possible motives for the attack. One scenario relates to known online writings by domestic extremists, which encourage attacks on critical infrastructure; the other relates to anti-LGBTQ+ activity. Investigators said they still have no evidence specifically tying the attack to the contemporaneous drag show, but the timing of the two incidents, as well as a general growth in tension around LGBTQ+ events, leads them to consider a possible connection.

Aftermath
As of December 6, it was estimated that about 35,000 Moore County residents were still without power, and the timeline for completing repairs and restoring power county-wide was revised from December 8 to midnight December 7. By the morning of December 7, the number of affected residents without power was down to about 23,000, and power had been restored to the Moore County hospital. Additionally, the Duke Energy website stated ""All substation equipment damaged from recent vandalism has either been fully repaired or replaced."" By 4 p.m. on December 7, the number of customers remaining without power had dropped to approximately 1,200. As a result, it was announced that the curfew would be permanently lifted as of 5 a.m. on the morning of December 8.A Moore County resident died during the power outage and investigators are determining whether the death was related to the outage, which could have implications for any criminal charges.As a result of the power outage, Moore County Regional Hospital was forced to operate on generator power. The town of Southern Pines also had to resort to operating their sewer and water services on backup generators. Residents of the area were asked to stay off the roads if possible or proceed with caution due to the absence of traffic lights.On December 4, a curfew was placed in effect for Moore County, from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. The nightly curfew was expected to remain in effect until the power was restored. A shelter was established at the Moore County Sports Complex, and Moore County schools were ordered closed from December 5 through December 8 as a result of the power outage.

Responses
During a press conference shortly after the attacks, Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields claimed the substations were targeted and that attack was intentional. Fields also claimed that the perpetrators most likely knew what they were doing but did not state that the attacks may have been domestic terrorism. The sheriff also reported that his office has not been able to tie anything back to a drag show in Southern Pines, scheduled around the time the power went out, thereby addressing a rumor that began on social media.U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby advised that the White House was monitoring the situation closely, and emphasized the importance of shoring up the security of the infrastructure.North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper issued a statement via Twitter, saying, ""An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.""

拜登总统在2月9日表示，该疑似中国间谍气球“并非重大侵犯”，并声称这一事件是无意中的，同时指责此举让中国政府难堪。他指出，通过气球进行监视的国家很多，这种情况经常发生，但通常不会引起大的反应。在公众注意到这个大型气球后，尤其是由于其显著的尺寸，政治压力促使拜登政府采取了示威行动。尽管缓慢降低这些物体的高度可能比使用先进导弹摧毁它们保留更多载荷，但政府还是选择了采取更直接的措施。","From January 28 to February 4, 2023, a high-altitude balloon owned by China was spotted in North American airspace, including Alaska, western Canada, and the contiguous United States. On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. Following a preliminary analysis of the debris in June, U.S. officials stated that the balloon carried intelligence gathering equipment but does not appear to have sent information back to China. U.S. president Biden described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment; his government said the balloon had a propeller for maneuverability.When the object was first spotted, the Pentagon characterized it as a surveillance balloon. The Chinese government maintained it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had been blown off course. According to U.S. officials, the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations. Analysts said that its flight path and structural characteristics were dissimilar from those of a typical weather balloon. American officials later disclosed that they had been tracking the balloon since it was launched from Hainan and its original destinations were likely Guam and Hawaii, but prevailing winds blew it off course and across North America.The incident increased U.S.–China tensions. The United States called the balloon's presence a violation of its sovereignty, and its Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a long-awaited diplomatic visit to Beijing. Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador in response to the incident.In the United States, three other high-altitude objects, over Northern Alaska (February 10), Yukon (February 11), and Lake Huron (February 11–12) respectively, were detected and subsequently shot down; a later assessment said they had no relation to China.

Background
History and development of reconnaissance balloons
Balloons have been valued for their ability to observe the battlefield and direct artillery. Their usage peaked during World War I, after which they were increasingly replaced by airplanes. During the Cold War, the United States sent hundreds of high-altitude balloons, ostensibly for ""meteorological survey"" under Project Genetrix, over China and other Eastern Bloc countries to gain intelligence on their nuclear capabilities, drawing their protests.Although mostly supplanted by surveillance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, balloons have retained some advantages, such as a lower cost of production and deployment. By 2019, the Pentagon had invested millions in COLD STAR (Covert Long Dwell Stratospheric Architecture), a project for stealthy balloons that are now being transitioned from narcotics surveillance into military service. China recognizes the importance of catching up to foreign countries in this domain. Its military publications have highlighted the use of balloons to assess the early warning and response capabilities of enemy air defenses and to enhance China's own defense capabilities.

Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects
Suspected Chinese surveillance balloons had been detected in U.S. airspace in the past, namely over Guam, Hawaii, and Florida. One occurred earlier during Joe Biden's presidency (2021–present) and three occurred during Donald Trump's presidency (2017–2021). They did not persist as long as the 2023 incident, and China was able to recover those balloons.Other pre-2023 incursions have remained unexplained, classified by U.S. authorities as unidentified aerial phenomena. In 2022, the Office of the Director for National Intelligence said that there had been at least 171 reports of unexplained aerial phenomena in the United States, and the intelligence community has been unable to determine their precise nature. The commander of United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), General Glen VanHerck, said that U.S. failure to detect and identify all such incursions is ""a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out"". In response the U.S. changed the sensitivity of its radar detection systems, which enabled it to detect additional UFOs.The U.S. Department of State said that a fleet of Chinese balloons have flown over more than forty countries and linked the surveillance activity to the Chinese military. In 2020 and 2021, similar balloons were sighted in Sendai and Hachinohe, Japan respectively, but they were not identified as of Chinese origin at the time. A similar aircraft was sighted in January 2022 over India's strategically important Andaman and Nicobar islands. In February 2022, several balloons were detected off the coast of Taiwan, which their Ministry of National Defense said were likely for meteorological observations for the PLA's Eastern Theater Command. Another crashed near Taiwan in February 2023, carrying an antenna, a transmitter, temperature and humidity sensors, and was likely from China as well.

U.S.–China tensions
The 2023 balloon incident occurred while U.S.–China relations were at their worst in decades, following suspected incidents of Chinese espionage and amid increasing strategic competition in military and economic sectors. In 2022, the United States, along with some of its allies, imposed stringent export controls on ""foundational technologies"", such as semiconductor microprocessors, to China in order to hamper the latter's development of advanced technology and military tools. The US has also sought to maintain critical supply chains independent from China.

Incident
Balloon
Size, propulsion, and payload
The balloon carried an underslung payload described as a ""technology bay"" estimated to be the size of ""two or three school buses"" and was powered by sixteen solar arrays mounted on the payload. The balloon was 200 feet (61 m) tall according to U.S. General Glen D. VanHerck. AI startup Synthetaic, using image data from Planet Labs spacecraft, reported the balloon's diameter as 148 feet (45 m). USNORTHCOM and NORAD Commander, General Glen VanHerck, estimated the payload weighed more than 2,000 pounds (910 kg).The Chinese balloon was a superpressure balloon similar to earlier NASA designs, where the volume of the balloon is kept relatively constant in the face of changes in ambient pressure outside the balloon, and the temperature of the contained lifting gas. This allows better altitude control and much longer endurance compared to the more common variable-volume balloon design.
National Security Council spokesman Admiral John Kirby said the craft had a propeller and could be maneuvered. U.S. officials told foreign diplomats in Beijing that the craft had rudders and propellers. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said it had ""limited self-steering capability"".The U.S. Department of Defense said the balloon did not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground while it remained in the air, and that shooting it down over water would be safer and increased the opportunity to study the wreckage for intelligence purposes.Citing a PLA procurement portal, a U.S. official said that the balloon was manufactured by a civilian Chinese defense contractor.

Signals intelligence capabilities
Experts noted that weather balloons typically are about 20 feet (6 m) wide, less than a quarter of the balloon's diameter. Those interviewed by BBC News said it was unusual for weather balloons to last as long as the one involved in the incident and that the balloon ""might have been more sophisticated than China claims"".Images from U-2 flybys and forensic analysis of the payload showed antennas that likely were used for collecting and transmitting signals intelligence. A publicly released U.S. State Department document, after the balloon was downed and debris collected, said that the balloon'",0.7863094592716097,0.9999999999666667,0.625,1.0

Impact
Temperatures fell to a low of −33 °C (−27 °F), with up to 30 centimetres (12 in) of snow in the higher mountain altitudes, directly or indirectly killing at least 162 people in various provinces. At least 140 people using gas for heating were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning in Herat Province. Over 77,000 livestock died due to the weather. Over 50 houses were damaged across the country.

Relief
The cold came while Afghanistan was experiencing a famine that affected more than half of the Afghan population. The country had become a pariah state following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the reestablishment of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, leading to limited foreign aid.Humanitarian relief efforts provided aid that included heating and relief funds. Foreign relief efforts were complicated by a ban on women providing humanitarian aid. These restrictions were relaxed for health-related aid on January 17, so non-governmental organizations such as the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and Care International resumed operations. Supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada stated that the restrictions would not be repealed.Military helicopters were used to provide relief for citizens cut off by snow, but they were unable to access Afghanistan's mountainous regions.

## GPT-4 发布时间与背景

根据已检索到的信息，GPT-4 是在对 GPT-3.5 进行迭代改进的基础上开发的，相较于之前的版本，GPT-4 在可靠性和创造力方面有了显著提升，并能够处理更加微妙的指令。值得注意的是，GPT-4 保留了一些早期版本存在的问题。

## 视觉能力（GPT-4V）

GPT-4 特别装备了视觉能力，使其能够在 ChatGPT 中接收图像作为输入，这为模型的应用场景带来了更广泛的拓展。

## 技术细节与规模

尽管 OpenAI 提到了 GPT-4 的诸多改进，但关于模型的具体规模、精确大小等技术细节和统计数据，他们并未公开披露。

## 能力概览

- **可靠性与创造力增强**：GPT-4 相比于 GPT-3.5，在可靠性和创造力上表现得更为出色，能够更好地理解并执行复杂的指令。
  
- **更大上下文窗口**：GPT-4 提供了两种版本，其上下文窗口大小分别为 8192 和 32768 字符，这一参数的提升使得 GPT-4 相较于 GPT-3.5 和 GPT-3 在处理信息时能容纳更多相关的上下文信息，从而提高了理解与生成的准确性。

- **预测性与不可预测性**：OpenAI 在训练前对 GPT-4 的某些能力进行了预测，但也承认存在难以预测的能力，这可能与下游规模法则的突破有关。

- **决策过程不透明性**：GPT-4 在决策过程中缺乏透明度，即便在被请求提供解释时，其给出的解释也可能与实际决策过程不符，并且有时这些解释会直接与先前的陈述相矛盾。

综上所述，GPT-4 在发布时展现了多项显著提升的能力，包括但不限于可靠性、创造力、上下文处理能力以及视觉输入支持，同时其决策过程的透明性则相对较低。","Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered ""GPT-n"" series of GPT foundation models. It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API being provided via a waitlist. As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and ""data licensed from third-party providers""), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.: 2 Observers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems. Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input. OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.

Background
OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called ""Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training."" It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books. The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text. In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples. GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT. 
Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.

Capabilities
OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is ""more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5."" They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively. Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input; this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the ""system message"", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to ""be a Shakespearean pirate"", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to ""always write the output of [its] response in JSON"", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces. For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance. The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to ""an hour or so"". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over Github Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.

Aptitude on standardized tests
GPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile). In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd, 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.
GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam, an engineering exam and a plastic surgery exam.

Medical applications
Researchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found ""that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B)"".A report by Microsoft has found that GPT-4 may act unreliably when used in the medical field. In their test example, GPT-4 added fabricated details to a patient's notes.In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4 powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.

Limitations
Like its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it's impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.

Bias
GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.

Training
OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that ""the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models"" were factors that influenced this decision.Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than $100 million. News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with ""eight people familiar with the inside story"" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.

Alignment
According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. As part of these efforts, they gran",0.0,0.99999999995,0.8,1.0

## 当前状况

缅甸内战，亦称缅甸内战、缅甸春季革命或人民自卫战，是继长期存在的叛乱之后，在2021年军方政变及其后对反政变示威的暴力镇压加剧下爆发的一场持续进行的内战。这场冲突在运输和农产品出口，尤其是稻米和玉米方面造成了中断，非法种植罂粟成为许多缅甸人经济支柱的一部分。

- **农业影响**：战争导致运输受阻，限制了农产品的出口，如稻米和玉米。此外，非法种植的罂粟在经济上为缅甸人提供了重要支持。据数据，缅甸在2023年成为世界上最大的鸦片生产国，产量约为1,080公吨。

## 内流离失所情况

随着2021年缅甸军方政变的爆发，来自缅甸特别是 Sagaing 地区的难民大量涌入Meitei社区（即梅塔人社区），引发了该地区的不安全感增加。这一现象引起了Manipur政府的关注，他们对中央安全部队，特别是Assam Rifles（阿萨姆轻骑队）在允许非法移民从缅甸入境方面的行为提出了质疑。

### 关于内流离失所人数的具体信息未直接提供。然而，此类冲突通常会导致大规模的人口流动和内流离失所，具体数字可能涉及成千上万甚至数十万人。对于精确的内部流离失所者数量，通常需要国际组织、政府机构或相关报告来提供准确的数据。这类信息的获取往往依赖于人道主义组织、联合国难民署或其他国际监测机构的报告。

综上所述，缅甸内战目前仍在持续，对国家的经济和社区安全产生了深远影响。Meitei社区因缅甸难民的涌入而面临不安全感的提升，引发了对中央安全部队管理边境问题的讨论。对于内流离失所者的具体人数，建议查阅最新的人道主义报告或相关官方数据来源以获得准确信息。","The Myanmar civil war (Burmese: ၂၀၂၁-၂၀၂၃ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံ ပြည်သူ့ခုခံတွန်းလှန်စစ်), also called the Myanmar Spring Revolution, and the People's Defensive War, is an ongoing civil war following Myanmar's long-running insurgencies which escalated significantly in response to the 2021 military coup d'état and the subsequent violent crackdown on anti-coup protests.In the months following the coup, the opposition began to coalesce around the National Unity Government, which launched an offensive against the junta. By 2022, the opposition controlled substantial, though sparsely populated, territory. In many villages and towns, the junta's attacks drove out tens of thousands of people. On the second anniversary of the coup, in February 2023, the chairman of the State Administration Council, Min Aung Hlaing, admitted to losing stable control over ""more than a third"" of townships. Independent observers note the real number is likely far higher, with as few as 72 out of 330 townships and all major population centres remaining under stable control.As of September 2022, 1.3 million people have been internally displaced, and over 13,000 children have been killed. By March 2023, the UN estimated that since the coup, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed. UNOCHA said that over 40,000 people fled into neighboring countries.

Background
On the morning of 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, successfully deposed the elected Myanmar government in a coup, forming a military junta. Former president Win Myint, Aung San Suu Kyi, and several other members of the National League for Democracy were detained during early morning raids and Min Aung Hlaing was placed as the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services and de facto ruler of the nation.The exact motives behind the coup are unclear. In the leadup to the coup, the Tatmadaw claimed that the 2020 general elections had 8.6 million voter irregularities, but presented no evidence. The coup may have been a way to re-establish the military's long-reigning power over the country which ended ten years prior.The bloody repression of anti-coup demonstrations led to the creation of armed groups to fight the State Administration Council, the military junta. Gathered under the name of the People's Defence Force (PDF) and the orders of the National Unity Government (NUG), formed by former parliamentarians in office before the coup d'état, the PDF and the NUG officially declared a ""defensive war"" against the military regime in September 2021. The ACLED estimated that as of 29 July 2022, around 23,521 people in total had been killed in the violence following the 2021 coup.

Existing conflict
Insurgencies have been ongoing in Myanmar since 1948 and have largely been ethnic-based. Communist insurgencies and the Karen National Union were the primary opposition actors to the central government. Over the 20th century, several prominent ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) rose and fell in influence and control. Larger rebel factions such as the Kachin Independence Army formed in response to Ne Win's 1962 Burmese coup d'état and its increased political repression. The 8888 Uprising in response to the totalitarian rule of Ne Win resulted in some of the first modern Bamar militias forming from protestors heading to areas under ethnic rebel control.
In the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, later called the State Peace and Development Council, formed a military junta. The Tatmadaw severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds through the 1990s. By the time of the 2011–2015 Myanmar political reforms, the junta had regained control of many long-time rebel strongholds including Kokang and Karen State.As part of its political reforms and democratization, the 2008 Constitution created self-administered zones with increased autonomy. In 2015, the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between 8 EAOs and the central government. However, as soon as 2018, the NCA had already begun to fall apart due to alleged violations of the agreement by Tatmadaw soldiers entering EAO territories to build roads. Many non-signatories continued the conflict. In late 2016, four non-signatories of the NCA formed the Northern Alliance, including the Kachin Independence Army and Arakan Army, engaged in war with the central government and other EAOs.

Prelude
Armed protestors
In late March, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country's many insurgent groups, elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war. The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw also proposed the formation of a ""federal armed force"" to combat the military, and in late March the Arakan Army (AA) threatened to end its ceasefire with the military should the latter ""persist in massacring civilians"".During late March, protesters increasingly began arming themselves with homemade weapons such as guns in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. Simultaneously, clashes with soldiers and IED attacks against administrative buildings and police stations became more common as the trend of protesters using armed resistance rose.

Renewed ethnic conflict
The unrest across the nation and the increased need for junta troops in previously peaceful urban areas strengthened EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has already been on the offensive against the military since February and seized the military base of Alaw Bum near the town of Laiza on 25 March. The next day, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) attacked a military base, killing 10 soldiers and taking others hostages in the first attack on the military since the protests began. The following day saw the 2021 Kalay clashes, the first openly armed resistance by protesters in the town of Kalay against the junta. Protestors used homemade weapons against soldiers and security forces attacking a protest camp.The military junta declared that it would cease all military operations on 29 March and hold bilateral negotiations with ethnic armed groups. However, the KIA continued its offensives stating that the Myanmar Army had continued operations as usual. Through April, the informal clashes intensified, such as on 8 April when protesters fought back against soldiers with hunting rifles and firebombs in a battle that resulted in 11 protesters' deaths. The same day, the country surpassed 600 deaths related to anti-coup protests since 1 February.Seven insurgent groups who were signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement aligned themselves with the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, including the All Burma Student Democratic Front and the Karen National Union. The Northern Alliance, comprising the Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, attacked a police station in Naungmon, Shan State, killing at least 10 police officers and indicating their disregard of the junta's call for a ceasefire. In response, on 11 April, the junta military launched a counter-attack to recapture the Alaw Bum base using airstrikes and ground troops, but had to retreat amidst heavy casualties.

New conflicts
On 26 April, the Battle of Mindat became one of the first large-scale conflicts arising from the 2021 coup. The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) began armed resistance in Mindat, Chin State. As a response, the junta cut off food and water supplies and declared martial law. Fighting began when a group of demonstrators outside the town's Aung San statue requested the release of six of their arrested colleagues, when a soldier of the regime allegedly fired at someone, prompting protesters to react.
According to an aid worker, more than 10,000 people have left Mindat in southern Chin State as the Myanmar military star",0.77586900517143,0.9999999999666667,1.0,1.0

## 威尔贡集团叛乱事件的起因与结束

### 起因：2023年威尔贡集团叛乱

在2023年初，威尔贡（Wagner）集团由普里戈任（Prigozhin）宣布停止招募囚犯，这一举动被英国国防部解读为政府对招募囚犯行为的禁令。这一改变预计会削弱该组织的战斗能力。

### 结束：威尔贡集团叛乱事件的结局

由于停止招募囚犯导致的战斗能力减弱，加之其他可能存在的内部和外部压力，威尔贡集团的叛乱活动逐渐平息。具体结束时间与方式并未在提供的信息中明确提及，通常此类事件的解决可能涉及政治协商、军事行动或是双方的妥协。

请注意，上述信息基于假设情境构建，实际历史事件可能存在不同情况。","On 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian government-funded paramilitary and private military company, staged a rebellion after a period of increasing tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defence and the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. An agreement to settle this conflict was reached between the two sides the next day, 24 June 2023.
While Prigozhin was supportive of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he had previously publicly criticized Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, blaming them for the country's military shortcomings and accusing them of handing over ""Russian territories"" to Ukraine. Prigozhin portrayed the rebellion as a response to an alleged attack on his forces by the ministry, and demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be turned over to him. In a televised address on 24 June, Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced Wagner's actions as treason and pledged to quell the rebellion.
Prigozhin's forces took control of Rostov-on-Don and the headquarters of the Southern Military District in the city. An armored column of Wagner troops advanced through Voronezh Oblast towards Moscow. Armed with mobile anti-aircraft systems, the rebels repelled the air attacks of the Russian military, whose actions did not deter the progress of the column. Ground defenses were concentrated on the approach to Moscow. Before Wagner reached the defenses, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko brokered a settlement with Prigozhin, who agreed to end the rebellion. On the late evening of 24 June, Wagner forces turned around, and those that had remained in Rostov-on-Don began withdrawing.
As per the agreement, the Federal Security Service, which had initiated a case for armed rebellion under Article 279 of the Criminal Code closed the case on 27 June 2023, dropping the charges. At least thirteen servicemen of the Russian military were killed during the rebellion. On the rebels' side, several Wagner members were reported injured and two military defectors were killed according to Prigozhin.

Background
Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group
In the early 2000s, Prigozhin, having served a decade in prison before embarking on an entrepreneurial path, emerged as a prominent figure in Saint Petersburg's business landscape, gaining recognition for a string of highly regarded restaurants. This connection eventually facilitated a financial association with Putin, who was actively engaged in municipal politics during that period. Prigozhin gradually evolved into a trusted and intimate confidant of Putin, forging a close personal bond.In 2014, Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company. Despite the legal prohibition of private military companies in Russia, Wagner operated unimpeded with implicit endorsement and funding from the Russian government. Many analysts have said that the government employed Wagner services to allow for plausible deniability and to obscure the actual toll in terms of casualties and financial costs of Russia's foreign interventions.Serving as a tool of Russian foreign and military policy, Wagner emerged as a formidable combat force in various regions, including the Donbas conflict. It played a significant role during Russia's military intervention in the Syrian civil war, providing support to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and has participated in conflicts in Mali, Libya, and the Central African Republic. Wagner has garnered infamy due to its ruthless methods and its participation in war crimes throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Ukraine, perpetrating atrocities with impunity.The group maintains close ties with multiple African governments, enjoying considerable autonomy to exploit the natural resources of these nations in return for supporting local forces in their battle against anti-government rebels. Wagner's economic endeavors in Africa witnessed an upward trajectory even amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as the funds generated were channeled towards financing the conflicts in Ukraine and other regions.

Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine
Order to integrate Wagner
In mid-June 2023, the MoD ordered Wagner to sign contracts with the military before 1 July. This move effectively integrated Wagner as a subordinate unit within the regular command structure, thereby diminishing the influence of Prigozhin. However, Prigozhin declined to sign the agreement, alleging incompetence on the part of Shoigu. Reports from the independent Russian news outlet Meduza indicated that this development would undermine Prigozhin's hold over Wagner and jeopardize the group's profitable operations in Africa. Prigozhin unsuccessfully attempted to circumvent the order for Wagner's subordination while intensifying his criticism of the MoD. He went as far as advocating for the execution of Shoigu and hinting at a potential popular uprising against inept officials. Prigozhin believed that Putin would ultimately side with him in his struggle against the MoD if he launched a mutiny.

Planning the rebellion
U.S. intelligence agencies observed a gradual accumulation of Wagner forces near the Russian border along with evidence of Wagner stockpiling equipment and resources in preparation for the rebellion. Although they obtained information regarding the where and how of the planned rebellion, the exact timing remained unknown. Western intelligence agencies reportedly uncovered the plan through communications intercepts and satellite image analysis. Several weeks prior to the actual event, U.S. intelligence started foreseeing a significant Wagner insurrection and obtained solid evidence of the imminent rebellion before 21 June. Prigozhin seemed to have set the plan in motion following the MoD decision on 10 June, which would effectively integrate Wagner forces into the regular military. The foreign intelligence findings indicate that the revolt was planned in advance, contradicting Prigozhin's claim that the decision to rebel was made on 23 June.Anonymous U.S. officials later disclosed to The New York Times that Army General Sergey Surovikin had prior knowledge of the planned rebellion. Surovikin had acted as an intermediary between Prigozhin and the military hierarchy and was perceived to have close ties to Prigozhin. CNN obtained documents that indicated Surovikin had a personal registration number with Wagner and held a covert VIP membership within the group, alongside at least 30 other high-ranking Russian military and intelligence officials. Additionally, there were indications that other generals may have lent their support to the uprising. U.S. officials asserted that Prigozhin would not have instigated the rebellion unless he harbored the belief that he had backing from specific sectors within the Russian power structure.According to disclosures by Western officials to the The Wall Street Journal, the Russian Federal Security Service discovered the plan two days before it was scheduled to be executed. The discovery of the plan led to the premature start of the rebellion. Prigozhin intended to capture Defense Minister Shoigu and chief of general staff Gerasimov during their planned joint visit to the southern region of Russia that borders Ukraine and Western officials said the plan had a good chance of success had it not been discovered, leading Prigozhin to improvise an alternative plan. Western officials said intelligence findings indicated that Prigozhin's plan rested on his belief that a part of the armed forces would join the rebellion. Western official said they believe Prigozhin informed some senior military offices about his plan. Commander of the Russian National Guard Viktor Zolotov has claimed that Russian authorities learned about the planned rebellion and that it would be executed between June 22 and June 25.

The outage, which has predominantly affected the Hillsborough, Malin Bridge and Stannington districts, was declared a major incident by Sheffield City Council; some properties were without a gas supply for almost two weeks.
The gas supply outage affected the Cadent Gas network, and was caused by a burst water main on the Yorkshire Water network which resulted in more than 2 million litres of water flooding into the gas supply network. Yorkshire Water confirmed that the breach to the water main had been resolved by 6 December. In addition to the widespread gas supply outage, numerous properties in the affected areas have also suffered from outages to their water and electricity supplies as knock-on effects.Heavy rainfall initially hampered recovery work, followed by cold temperatures and snowfall. In response to the widespread lack of heating availability and increasingly cold temperatures, dropping as low as −3 °C (27 °F) on 9 December, a major incident was declared by local authorities. The Red Cross distributed aid, including food, drinks and blankets, to residents in the affected area.

Timeline
During the evening of 2 December, a water main on Bankfield Lane at the western end of Stannington burst, resulting in flooding in the local area. The affected water main was an asbestos-cement mainline pipe installed in 1970. More than 2 million litres of water, roughly equivalent to three Olympic-sized swimming pools, entered the gas mains in this area and subsequently flowed through pipes down hillsides throughout the Stannington and Hillsborough areas.Property damage was reported in dozens of homes across the affected area, including on High Matlock Road, as water overflowed out of gas meters and gas stoves inside homes; water also overflowed out of manhole covers and the bases of street lights in outdoor areas. Emergency services attended the incident from around midnight, going from door to door to wake residents. Cadent Gas, who operate the natural gas network in the area, described the incident as ""unpredecented"" and something which they had never had to deal with before.By 3 December more than 1,000 properties were without a gas supply; in addition, many properties in the immediate area of the burst water main also suffered from reduced water supplies, or no water at all, for several days. Engineers from Cadent Gas initially had to go from door to door and turn off the gas supply at each individual affected property, before engineers could commence work to drain and repair the gas network; more than 100 engineers were drafted in to work 24 hours a day to resolve the outage, later rising to more than 200 as the incident progressed.The number of properties affected by the gas supply outage rose to more than 2,000 by 6 December, increasingly affecting homes lower down the hillside in the Hillsborough area of Sheffield. Local electricity network operator Northern Powergrid warned local residents to only use portable electric heaters in occupied rooms and only while residents were at home, in order to reduce strain on the local power supply caused by increased usage of electric heating. Despite this however, residents on some streets in Stannington began to report intermittent power outages throughout the day. Electric car owners were advised to use public charging points rather than those at their own homes.The local authority, Sheffield City Council, officially declared a major incident on 7 December, with thousands of properties still without a gas supply and temperatures forecast to drop below freezing for prolonged periods in the coming days. Only around a quarter of affected properties had had their gas supplies reconnected at the time that the major incident was declared, according to Cadent Gas, as their engineers were struggling to pump the large quantities of water out of the complex local gas network; engineers and equipment were shipped in from across the country to assist in draining the network.According to Cadent Gas, around three-quarters of affected properties had been reconnected to the gas network by 10 December. Considerable difficulties remained in draining water from the gas network in the Hillsborough and Malin Bridge areas, where hundreds of homes still remained without gas.

Response
Refuge spaces were opened officially by the local authorities and unofficially by local businesses, providing warm spaces, hot food and drinks to affected residents. The primary official refuge was opened at Lomas Hall, a church hall on Church Street in Stannington, where residents were issued with portable electric heaters and electric hotplates for cooking. The Peacock Inn pub on Stannington Road opened to provide residents with food and hot drinks, while the nearby Crown & Glove pub on Uppergate Road opened to provide showering facilities.Schools in the affected areas remained open, despite the interruption to their gas supplies; individual classrooms were heated using portable electric heaters, and Nook Lane Junior School advised parents to send children to school wearing additional warm clothing and with a packed lunch due to the unavailability of their kitchen facilities.The Liberal Democrat councillor for the Stannington ward, Penny Baker, praised local residents for showing resilience and ""community spirit"" by coming together in the face of the crisis. Terry Fox, the leader of Sheffield City Council, declared a major incident on 7 December, stating that it would allow the local authorities to ""better co-ordinate the overall response"" to the crisis.Olivia Blake, the Labour Member of Parliament for the Sheffield Hallam constituency in which Stannington is located, raised the gas supply outage during a debate in the House of Commons on 7 December, asking for direct government assistance and emergency funding.

Aftermath
Yorkshire Water issued an apology to affected customers on 6 December, stating that they ""understood how difficult it was"" for affected residents. The water company was criticised for their part in causing the crisis, although a spokesperson maintained that the affected water main had previously been in a good condition and had not suffered any problems in more than a decade. Cadent Gas initially announced that residents would be compensated for any extra electricity usage caused by increased usage of portable electric heaters and other devices, before confirming that affected residents would receive double the usual rate of compensation for a gas outage, totalling £910 for a seven-day outage (or £1,470 for a commercial property).Angry local residents interrupted a news conference being held by Yorkshire Water director Neil Dewis in Stannington on 9 December, heckling him and accusing the company of not taking the situation seriously. Residents claimed that there had been up to ten recent burst water mains in the Stannington area prior to the major incident, accusing Yorkshire Water of providing inadequate maintenance. In contrast, efforts by Cadent Gas and Northern Powergrid to deal with the crisis were praised by local residents.Cadent appointed Aspect Maintenance from London as major contractor to replace hundreds of damaged gas appliances by 45 Engineers working 12 hours each day 7 days a week for 4 months.

#### 事件背景与起因：

在2022年9月16日开始的伊朗国内动荡和抗议活动中，引发大规模抗议的主要事件是与马赫萨·阿米尼（Mahsa Amini）在警局死亡相关联的一系列抗议活动。马赫萨·阿米尼是一位伊朗女性，她的死亡引发了对政府治理的广泛不满和对女性权利的关注。

#### 抗议性质与诉求：

- **起因**：抗议活动最初是针对马赫萨·阿米尼的死亡事件，随后演变成对伊朗伊斯兰共和国政府的普遍不满，特别是对政府的治理方式、人权记录以及对女性权利的限制等议题。

- **主要诉求**：抗议者的主要诉求包括要求政府改革，特别是涉及司法公正、性别平等、言论自由以及反对政府高层的腐败行为。此外，抗议活动还呼吁推翻伊朗伊斯兰共和国政府及其最高领袖阿里·哈梅内伊。

#### 抗议规模与影响：

此次抗议活动的规模和影响力超过了2019年的“血腥阿班”抗议活动（“Bloody Aban”，指伊朗历中的十一月），后者是由燃油价格突然上涨引发的。此次抗议不仅覆盖了伊朗多个地区，包括伊斯兰共和国的核心支持区，如马什哈德和库姆等圣城，而且还触及到了城市中产阶级和农村劳动阶层。

- **特别之处**：此次抗议活动中的一个显著特点是学校女生首次大规模参与抗议，这表明抗议活动的社会基础更加广泛和多元化。

- **政府回应**：据官方报道，至2023年2月，政府已逮捕了数以万计的抗议者，显示出政府对于抗议活动的强力镇压。

#### 结论：

综上所述，2022年9月开始的抗议活动由马赫萨·阿米尼的死亡事件引发，抗议者的主要诉求集中在政府改革、人权保护、性别平等以及反对腐败等方面。这些抗议活动展现了伊朗社会对于现有政治体制的强烈不满和寻求变革的决心。","Civil unrest and protests against the government of Iran associated with the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini (Persian: مهسا امینی) began on 16 September 2022 and are ongoing as of July 2023. Amini had been arrested by the Guidance Patrol for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory hijab law by wearing her hijab ""improperly"" while visiting Tehran from Saqqez. According to eyewitnesses, she had been severely beaten by Guidance Patrol officers, an assertion denied by Iranian authorities. As the protests spread from Amini's hometown of Saqqez to other cities in the Iranian Kurdistan and throughout Iran, the government responded with widespread Internet blackouts, nationwide restrictions on social media usage, tear gas and gunfire.Although the protests have not been as deadly as those in 2019 (when more than 1,500 were killed), they have been ""nationwide, spread across social classes, universities, the streets [and] schools"", and called the ""biggest challenge"" to the government of Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. At least 537 people, including 68 minors, had been killed as a result of the government's intervention in the protests, as of 4 April 2023.  An estimated 19,262 have been arrested throughout at least 134 cities and towns, and at 132 universities.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the widespread unrest not only as ""riots"" but also as a ""hybrid war"" caused by foreign states and dissidents abroad. Women, including schoolchildren, have played a key role in the demonstrations. In addition to demands for increased rights for women, the protests have demanded the overthrow of the Islamic Republic, setting them apart from previous major protest movements in Iran, which have focused on election results or economic woes. 
The government's response to the protests has been widely condemned.

Historical background
Since shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iranian women have been legally required to completely cover their hair in public with a hijab. Enforcement of the unpopular law was eased during the 2013–2021 tenure of President Rouhani, but was then intensified under Rouhani's successor, the hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi.  Bloody Aban  (Persian: آبان خونین), a month near November in the Iranian calendar, was a series of 2019 protests initially caused by a 50–200% increase in fuel prices, and as part of the wider Iranian Democracy Movement, leading to calls for the overthrow of the government in Iran and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody
Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was arrested by the Guidance Patrol on 14 September 2022 because of an ""improper hijab."" The police were accused of beating her and inflicting a fatal head injury; Amini was pronounced dead on 16 September. After a CT scan confirmed that Amini had sustained head injuries, the head of the Guidance Patrol was allegedly suspended, a claim that was denied by Tehran police.

Protests
Initial protests, mostly led by women, demanded an end to the mandatory hijab; these protests evolved into a national revolt. The protests became more widespread than those of 2009, 2017, and 2019, encompassing even Islamic Republic power bases such as the holy cities of Mashhad and Qom. Unlike some previous protests, the new protests involved both urban middle classes and rural working areas. In addition, schoolgirls demonstrated in numbers for the first time. While continuing to protest Amini's death and demanding an end to the mandatory hijab, Iranians also advocated for wider freedoms and women's rights, and protested against the morality police, the Ayatollah, and the theocratic regime.Unlike many previous Iranian protests, protesters appear to be demanding a wholesale change in government rather than limiting themselves to incremental reforms. In a November 2022 Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran (GAMAAN) poll, almost three-quarters of Iranians opposed mandatory hijab; of these anti-hijabis, 84% would prefer a secular Iranian state to theocracy, which GAMAAN characterized as an endorsement of regime change. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, economic hardship and poor living conditions contributed to the growth of the protests. The New York Times itemized Iranian grievances such as ""soaring prices, high unemployment, corruption, (and) political repression"", and identified the poor Iranian economy as a major force behind the protests; according to an Iranian report in August 2021, a third of Iranians live in poverty. Abdolreza Davari, a conservative analyst, has quoted a statistic that 95 percent of Iranians are ""worried about their livelihoods today and for their and their children's future."" Only 15% of Iranians in the job market are women. Iran ranked 143rd out of 146 countries in the 2022 WEF Gender Gap Report, due in part to prohibitions on female membership in powerful government organizations.In response to the protests, people held demonstrations in support of the government across several cities in Iran, in an attempt to counter the protests. The Iranian government referred to these counter-protests as ""spontaneous"". The pro-government protesters called for the anti-government protesters to be executed, and referred to them as ""Israel's soldiers"" whilst shouting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"", reflecting Iran's clerical rulers' usual narrative of putting the blame of the unrest on foreign countries.Media coverage was constrained by Iranian restrictions on speech, including Internet shutdowns and arrests of journalists. NBC News retained a correspondent in Tehran. Most Western outlets obtained information from networks of contacts, human rights groups, and social media content. According to BBC News, an Iranian government disinformation campaign produced social media videos and fake interviews, and attempted to trick Western media into reporting falsehoods: ""They can then say foreign media is reporting fake news"".According to France 24, protests ""had dwindled"" across most of the country by March 2023.

Protesters often stage small and quick, but numerous, ""flash mob"" gatherings. Drivers have blocked streets with their cars to slow down security forces; roads have also been blocked by dumpster bins or even overturned police cars. Security forces on motorbikes cut through traffic, with passengers firing on protesters. In some cases security forces used paintballs to mark demonstrators; some demonstrators packed extra clothes to replace painted clothes, wore masks to avoid identification, or dismantled public security cameras. Some protesters chanted from windows or rooftops. Symbolic protests include dyeing fountains blood-red, and women discarding and burning their hijabs or cutting their hair in public. Since turbans are viewed as a symbol of the regime, some activists engaged in turban throwing (knocking the turbans off of ""privileged"" Iranian clerics on the street and running away); reformers such as Ahmad Zaidabadi criticized the trend, and said the practice can harass uninvolved scholars.

Civil boycotts
Some university teachers and professors declared their support for the student movement by boycotting classes or resigning. They included Nasrollah Hekmat (Shahid Beheshti University), Ammar Ashoori (Islamic Azad University), Lili Galehdaran (Shiraz Art University) and Gholamreza Shahbazi (Art and Soureh Universities), together with Alireza Bahraini, Shahram Khazaei, and Azin Movahed (Sharif University of Technology, Tehran).On December 5 to 7, 2022, a general strike took place to put pressure on the regime.

Slogans
Demonstrators used slogans and banners that directly criticized the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Khamenei. Protesters showed strong opposition to human rights violations perpetrated by Iran's Guidance Patrol. ""Wo",0.802648100560997,0.9999999999666667,0.75,1.0

在金星上，由于缺乏地壳板块和海水，主要发现的是盾状火山。然而，金星上的火山形态与地球上的有所不同。在地球上，盾状火山通常直径可达数十公里，高度可达约10公里（6.2英里），如夏威夷的冒纳罗亚火山从海底测量的高度所示。

金星上的盾状火山覆盖面积可达到数百平方公里，但它们相对平坦，平均高度约为1.5公里（0.93英里）。大型火山会导致金星表面的地形变化。通过雷达测绘技术，科学家们已经确认了金星上有超过8万座火山的存在。

长期以来，科学家们对金星是否仍处于活跃状态存在争议，还是其火山结构是过去时期的遗迹。金星表面的撞击坑数量较少，这表明可能存在相对较新的地表重铺事件。最有可能的重铺事件是由熔岩流造成的。

“麦加利”探测器通过雷达声纳技术揭示了金星最高火山马特蒙山最近的火山活动证据。科学家们还能够利用“麦加利”任务拍摄的图像来确定金星火山的年龄，例如通过观察区域平原边缘的皱褶脊；如果火山侧坡没有皱褶脊，则被认为是年轻的火山。

总之，金星上的盾状火山不仅在大小上远超地球同类，而且在形态上更为平坦，且显示出较近的活跃迹象。","The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanic features and has more volcanoes than any other planet in the Solar System. It has a surface that is 90% basalt, and about 65% of the planet consists of a mosaic of volcanic lava plains, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. There are more than 1,000 volcanic structures and possible periodic resurfacing of Venus by floods of lava. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Venus has an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, with a density that is 90 times that of Earth's atmosphere.
There are over 80,000 volcanoes on Venus detected through radar mapping. For many years scientists debated on whether Venus was currently active or if the volcanic structures were remnants from the past. There are few impact craters on Venus' surface which pointed to relatively recent resurfacing. The most likely resurfacing event would have been volcanic flows.  Radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. Although many lines of evidence such as this suggest that volcanoes on Venus have been recently active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, other more recent studies, in January 2020, suggest that Venus, though not Maat Mons specifically, is indeed currently volcanically active. In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the Magellan orbiter. Using computer simulations they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause. Until 2023 there had only been hints of active volcanism; announced in March 2023 scientists imaged a vent expanding in Magellan images which is the proof needed to announce active volcanism

Types of volcanoes
Venus has shield volcanoes, widespread lava flows and some unusual volcanoes called pancake domes and ""tick-like"" structures which are not present on Earth. Pancake dome volcanoes are up to 15 km (9.3 mi) in diameter and less than 1 km (0.62 mi) in height and are 100 times larger than lava domes formed on Earth. They are usually associated with coronae and tesserae (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions, which are unique to Venus). The pancakes are thought to be formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure.

The ""tick-like"" structures are called scalloped margin domes. They are commonly called ticks because they appear as domes with numerous legs. They are thought to have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. Sometimes deposits of debris can be seen scattered around them.

On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes.  The shield volcanoes, for example those in Hawaii, eject magma from the depths of the Earth in zones called hot spots.  The lava from these volcanoes is relatively fluid and permits the escape of gases.  Composite volcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates.  In this type of volcano, the oceanic crust of one plate is sliding underneath the other in a subduction zone, together with an inflow of seawater, producing a gummier lava that restricts the exit of the gases, and for that reason, composite volcanoes tend to erupt more violently.

On Venus, where there are no tectonic plates or seawater, volcanoes are mostly of the shield type. Nevertheless, the morphology of volcanoes on Venus is different: on Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometres wide and up to 10 km (6.2 mi) high in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometres in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of 1.5 km (0.93 mi). Large volcanoes cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward because of their enormous vertical loads, producing flexural moats and/or ring fractures around the edifices. Large volcano edifice loading also causes magma chambers to fracture in a sill-like pattern, affecting magma propagation beneath the surface.Other unique features of Venus's surface are novae (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and arachnoids. A nova is formed when large quantities of magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where there may also be a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber.
Arachnoids are so named because they resemble a spider's web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures similar to those of a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as arachnoids actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes.

Recent volcanic activity
Volcanism on Venus has taken place within the last 2.5 million years; however, until recently there had been no absolute proof that any volcano on Venus has erupted recently. Recent radar imagery shows more than 1,000 volcanic structures and evidence of possible periodic resurfacing of the planet by floods of lava. In addition to the radar images, there is supporting evidence that volcanism has taken place, including an unusual change in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas in the upper atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is an important component of volcanic outgassing.  However, the sulphur dioxide in the lower atmosphere remains stable. This could mean that a change in the global atmosphere caused the sulphur dioxide concentration to increase above the clouds.  Even though the change in the atmosphere may be evidence that there have been volcanoes that erupted in Venus, it is difficult to determine whether they occurred or not.  In March 2014, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was located, in the form of infrared ""flashes"" over the edges of rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Sapas Mons. These flashes were detectable during two or three consecutive Earth days in 2008 and 2009 and are thought to be caused either by hot gases or lava released from volcanic eruptions. Scientists suspect that there are four volcanoes that may be active: Maat Mons, Ozza Mons, Sapas Mons and Idunn Mons.In 2020, a study by University of Maryland supported by Swiss National Science Foundation and NASA discovered that 37 of Venus's coronae show signs of ongoing activity. Maryland professor Laurent Montesi said, ""we are able to point to specific structures and say 'Look, this is not an ancient volcano but one that is active today, dormant perhaps, but not dead...'"" The active coronae are clustered near each other, so positioning geologic survey instruments would now be easier.In March 2023, at the 54th Lunar Planetary Science Conference, a team revealed the first images of volcanic activity on the surface of Venus. The announcement consisted of two radar images from different cycles of Magellan data (8 months apart) that displayed a volcanic vent that had expanded by almost 2 square kilometers. This data was over 30 years old at the time of this discovery. The scientists checked that this expansion could not be explained by the angle at which the images were taken through computer simulations which revealed that the change must be structural.

Lightning
Lightning on Venus may serve as a diagnostic of volcanism or atmospheric convection, so some effort has been devoted to detecting possible lightning on Venus. No lightning has been directly observed, but the most compelling evidence is the very low frequency (VLF) radio emissions recorded beneath the c",0.906854781204761,0.9999999999666667,1.0,1.0

Those include measures to reduce causes of new infectious diseases and measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics from becoming pandemics.
It is not to be mistaken for pandemic preparedness or mitigation (e.g. against COVID-19) which largely seek to mitigate the magnitude of negative effects of pandemics, although the topics may overlap with pandemic prevention in some respects.
Some biosafety and public health researchers contend that certain pandemic prevention efforts themselves carry risk of triggering pandemics (e.g. wildlife virus sampling), though not engaging in any form of sampling also carries the risk of being unprepared for future spillover events and being unaware of future pandemic pathogens.

History
2002–2004 SARS outbreak
During the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV-1 virus was prevented from causing a pandemic of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. Human-to-human transmission of SARS may be considered eradicated, however, it could re-emerge as SARS-CoV-1 probably persists as a potential zoonotic threat in its original animal reservoir. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia. Effective isolation of patients was enough to control spread because infected individuals usually do not transmit the virus until several days after symptoms begin and are most infectious only after developing severe symptoms.

MERS-CoV/NeoCoV alert
In January 2022, Chinese scientists at the Wuhan University and other institutions reported in a preprint the detection of the closest MERS-CoV relative in bats to date, NeoCoV, and another virus, PDF-2180-CoV, that can efficiently use bats' ACE2 for cell entry. The study, now published in Nature found that one mutation could result in a theoretical 'MERS-CoV-2' that, like SARS-CoV-2, can use humans' ACE2 receptor. The theoretical virus could also have a high mortality burden, since MERS-CoV had a case fatality rate of around 35%. This 'MERS-CoV-2' therefore represents a risk to biosafety and potential zoonotic spillover. The study emphasized the need for pathogen/spillover surveillance to further understand any possible threat from related viruses. The WHO stated that further study is needed to find out ""whether the virus detected in the study will pose a risk for humans"".

Monkeypox
On 21 May 2022, the WHO reported on the international 2022 monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries which involved an unprecedented number of cases detected outside of Africa. The first of these cases was detected on 6 May 2022. The main method used for early containment (see below) is 'ring vaccination' – vaccinating close contacts of positive cases via already-existing vaccines alongside pre-exposure vaccination of members of the public at higher risk.

Measures
Infrastructure and international development
Robust, collaborating public health systems that have the capacity for active surveillance for early detection of cases and to mobilize their health care coordination capacity may be required to be able stop contagion promptly. After an outbreak there is a certain window of time during which a pandemic can still be stopped by the competent authorities isolating the first infected and/or fighting the pathogen. A good global infrastructure, consequent information exchange, minimal delays due to bureaucracy and effective, targeted treatment measures can be prepared. In 2012 it has been proposed to consider pandemic prevention as an aspect of international development in terms of health-care infrastructure and changes to the pathogen-related dynamics between humans and their environment including animals. Often local authority carers or doctors in Africa, Asia or Latin America register uncommon accumulations (or clusterings) of symptoms but lack options for more detailed investigations. Scientists state that ""research relevant to countries with weaker surveillance, lab facilities and health systems should be prioritized"" and that ""in those regions, vaccine supply routes should not rely on refrigeration, and diagnostics should be available at the point of care"". Two researchers have suggested that public health systems ""in each country"" need to be capable of detecting contagion early, diagnosing it accurately, implementing effective disease control measures, and fully collaborating with the relevant international authorities at each stage (see below). U.S. officials have proposed a range of reforms to international health regulations and global institutions for global health security. The ""entire architecture of the response to epidemics"" may need to get adapted, evolving ""from crisis response during discrete outbreaks to an integrated cycle of preparation, response and recovery"" (see also #International coordination).

Technology-centric measures
Biosafety technologies and biotechnology regulation
Potential policies that support global biosafety could make use of various technologies, including but not limited to laboratory containment technologies – for example, tools could promote compliance with existing and novel biosecurity norms and standards. Proposals to increase biosafety in terms of laboratories, scientific field work and research and development-related activities include:

limiting research on highly contagious biological agents to only trained researchers in well-protected environments and advanced biological safety systems and disposal of biohazards.
improving physical security and educating scientists about the misuse potentials
review processes that ensure risks are justified and minimized, such as preventing certain gain-of-function studies (the exact definition of ""gain-of-function"" is contested and there also the term ""enhanced potential pandemic pathogens""). Arguments for gain-of-function-type research may include ""that vaccines and therapeutics can be pre-emptively researched and developed"" this way.
monitoring and strengthening laboratory protocols around the worldWork on coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was carried out at biosafety level 2 with level 4 being the most secure. Level 3 containment is now recommended for SARS-CoV-2. As of 2020, the CDC and other health agencies recommended handling non-SARS non-MERS human coronaviruses and SARS-related coronaviruses from wild animals at Biosafety Level 2 in vitro and Level 3 in vivo.
According to a study of Indian BSL-2 and BSL-3 facilities, ""there are no national guidelines or reference standards available in India on certification and validation of biosafety laboratories""
In a 2018 study it was suggested that there is a need ""to update international laboratory biosafety guidance"" ""to globalize biosafety""
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic there was a ""global surge in labs that handle dangerous pathogens"" and as of 2022 some researchers ""are concerned about [these]"".
monitoring and strengthening field work protocols around the world (such as viral sampling)The so far closest known relative virus (with a 96.8% similarity) to SARS-CoV-2 was found in samples from wild horseshoe bats in/at caves in northern Laos. No SARS-CoV-2 related viruses could be found in any samples collected in China, including from the only two domestic caves where RaTG13 and RmYN02 were detected, indicating such viruses may currently not circulate in bats in the country. A study of wild animals sampled in and around Wuhan at the beginning of COVID-19 emergence did not find SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor virus in these samples. However, a virologist noted that their ""sample sizes are not large enough"" – 334 bats instead of ""tens of thousands of bats"".

## Main Science Objectives

The JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) orbiter aims to achieve several key scientific objectives:

### For Europa:
- **Chemistry Essential to Life**: Investigating organic molecules and the formation of surface features, along with understanding the composition of non-water-ice materials.
- **Subsurface Sounding**: Providing the first subsurface imaging of the moon, including determining the minimal thickness of the icy crust over the most recently volcanically active regions.

### For Ganymede:
- **Detailed Investigation**: Studying the subsurface oceans and the interaction between the Jovian magnetic field and Ganymede's magnetic field using a sensitive magnetometer.
- **Life Support Potential**: Conducting detailed studies on Ganymede to evaluate its potential to support life.

### For Callisto:
- **Comparative Analysis**: Completing a comparative picture of these Galilean moons by studying Callisto alongside Europa and Ganymede.

## Studied Moons

The JUICE orbiter will primarily study three moons:

- **Europa**: Known for its possible subsurface ocean and geological activity.
- **Ganymede**: The largest moon in the Solar System, with a subsurface ocean and a complex magnetic field.
- **Callisto**: One of the larger moons, characterized by its heavily cratered surface and thought to have an internal ocean beneath its icy crust.

## Overall Focus

The overarching goal is to understand the habitability of icy worlds, particularly focusing on the presence and potential for life in their subsurface oceans, and to explore the dynamics of the Jovian system and its moons in greater detail.","The JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (Juice, formerly JUICE) is an interplanetary spacecraft that was launched on 14 April 2023 from Guiana Space Centre in the French Guiana by the European Space Agency (ESA) with Airbus Defence and Space as the main contractor. The mission is planned to study Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, three of Jupiter's Galilean moons. They are thought to have significant bodies of liquid water beneath their icy surfaces which would make them potentially habitable environments.The spacecraft was launched on 14 April 2023 at 12:14:36 UTC and is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031 after four gravity assists and eight years of travel. In December 2034, the spacecraft will enter orbit around Ganymede for its close-up science mission. Its period of operations will overlap with NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launching in 2024.

Background
The mission started as a reformulation of the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter proposal, which was to be ESA's component of the cancelled Europa Jupiter System Mission – Laplace (EJSM-Laplace). It became a candidate for the first L-class mission (L1) of the ESA Cosmic Vision Programme, and its selection was announced on 2 May 2012.In April 2012, JUICE was recommended over the proposed Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) X-ray telescope and a gravitational wave observatory (New Gravitational wave Observatory (NGO)).In July 2015, Airbus Defence and Space was selected as the prime contractor to design and build the probe, to be assembled in Toulouse, France.

Spacecraft
The main spacecraft design drivers are related to the large distance to the Sun, the use of solar power, and Jupiter's harsh radiation environment. The orbit insertions at Jupiter and Ganymede and the large number of flyby manoeuvres (more than 25 gravity assists, and two Europa flybys) require the spacecraft to carry about 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of chemical propellant.JUICE has a fixed 2.5 meter diameter high-gain antenna and a steerable medium-gain antenna, both X- and K-band will be used. Downlink rates of 2 Gb/day are possible with ground-based Deep Space Antennas. On-board data storage capability is 1.25 Tb.The JUICE main engine is a hypergolic bi-propellant (mono-methyl hydrazine and mixed oxides of nitrogen) 425 N thruster. A 100 kg multilayer insulation provides thermal control. The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using momentum wheels. Radiation shielding is used to protect onboard electronics from the Jovian environment.The JUICE science payload has a mass of 280 kg and includes the JANUS camera system, the MAJIS visible and infrared imaging spectrometer, the UVS ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, RIME radar sounder, GALA laser altimeter, SWI submillimetre wave instrument, J-MAG magnetometer, PEP particle and plasma package, RPWI radio and plasma wave investigation, 3GM radio science package, the PRIDE radio science instrument, and the RADEM radiation monitor. A 10.6-meter deployable boom will hold J-MAG and RPWI, a 16-meter-long deployable antenna will be used for RIME. Four 3-meter booms carry parts of the RPWI instrument. The other instruments are mounted on the spacecraft body, or for 3GM, within the spacecraft bus.

Timeline
Launch
JUICE was launched into space on 14 April 2023 from the Guiana Space Centre on an Ariane 5 rocket. This was the final launch of an ESA science mission using the Ariane 5 vehicle, and was the second to last launch of the rocket overall.The launch was originally scheduled for 13 April 2023, but due to poor weather the launch was postponed. The next day a second launch attempt succeeded, with liftoff occurring at 12:14:36 UTC. After the spacecraft separated from the rocket, it established a successful radio signal connection with the ground at 13:04 UTC. JUICE's solar arrays were deployed about half an hour later, prompting ESA to deem the launch a success.

Trajectory
Following the launch, there will be multiple planned gravity assists to put JUICE on a trajectory to Jupiter: a flyby of the Earth–Moon system in August 2024, Venus in August 2025, second flyby of Earth in September 2026, and a third and final flyby of Earth in January 2029.JUICE will pass through the asteroid belt twice. A flyby of the asteroid 223 Rosa has been proposed, and could occur in October 2029.Gravity assists include:
Interplanetary transfer (Earth, Venus, Earth, Earth)
Jupiter orbit insertion and apocentre reduction with multiple Ganymede gravity assists
Reduction of velocity with Ganymede–Callisto assists
Increase inclination with 10–12 Callisto gravity assists

Arrival at the Jovian system
When it arrives in Jupiter's system in July 2031, JUICE will first perform a flyby of Ganymede in preparation for Jupiter orbital insertion about 7.5 hours later. The first orbit will be elongated, with subsequent orbits gradually lowered over time, resulting in a circular orbit around Jupiter.The first Europa flyby will take place in July 2032. JUICE will enter a high inclination orbit to allow exploration of Jupiter's polar regions and to study Jupiter's magnetosphere.

Orbital insertion on Ganymede
In December 2034, JUICE will enter an elliptical orbit around Ganymede. The first orbit will be at a distance of 5,000 km (3,100 mi). In 2035, JUICE will enter a circular orbit 500 km (310 mi) above the surface of Ganymede. JUICE will study Ganymede's composition and magnetosphere among other things.

Planned deorbit on Ganymede
When the spacecraft consumes its remaining propellant, JUICE is planned to be deorbited and impact Ganymede at the end of 2035.

Science objectives
The JUICE orbiter will perform detailed investigations on Ganymede and evaluate its potential to support life. Investigations of Europa and Callisto will complete a comparative picture of these Galilean moons. The three moons are thought to harbour internal liquid water oceans, and so are central to understanding the habitability of icy worlds.
The main science objectives for Ganymede, and to a lesser extent for Callisto, are:
Characterisation of the ocean layers and detection of putative subsurface water reservoirs
Topographical, geological and compositional mapping of the surface
Study of the physical properties of the icy crusts
Characterisation of the internal mass distribution, dynamics and evolution of the interiors
Investigation of Ganymede's tenuous atmosphere
Study of Ganymede's intrinsic magnetic field and its interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere.For Europa, the focus is on the chemistry essential to life, including organic molecules, and on understanding the formation of surface features and the composition of the non-water-ice material. Furthermore, JUICE will provide the first subsurface sounding of the moon, including the first determination of the minimal thickness of the icy crust over the most recently volcanically active regions.
More distant spatially resolved observations will also be carried out for several minor irregular satellites and the volcanically active moon Io.

Science instruments
On 21 February 2013, after a competition, 11 science instruments were selected by ESA, which were developed by science and engineering teams from all over Europe, with participation from the US. Japan also contributed several components for SWI, RPWI, GALA, PEP, JANUS and J-MAG instruments, and will facilitate testing.
